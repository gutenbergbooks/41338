<p class="chap">THE LAKE FRONT IN CHICAGO</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>I sleep out&mdash;A companion&mdash;Hunting a job&mdash;Free lunch and a
bad friend&mdash;Steele's store and what happened there&mdash;A positive
young woman&mdash;Number twelve</i></p></blockquote>


<p>It was a raw, blustering September night when I
rounded up for the first time at the lake front in
Chicago. There was just a strip of waste land, in those
days, between the great avenue and the railroad tracks
that skirted the lake. In 1876 there were no large hotels
or skyscrapers fronting a tidy park; nothing but some
wooden or brick houses, and, across the tracks, the waves
lapped away at the railroad embankment. I was something
more than twenty, old enough, at any rate, to have
earned a better bed than a few feet of sand and sooty
grass in a vacant lot. It was the first night I had ever
slept out,&mdash;at least, because there was no place I had a
right to go to. All that day I had been on the tramp
from Indiana, and reached the city with only a few cents
in my pockets.</p>

<p>I was not the only homeless wanderer by any means.
Early in the evening a lot of bums began to drop in,
slinking down the avenue or coming over from the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
through the cross streets. It was early in the season;
but to-night the east wind raked the park and shook
gusts of rain from the low clouds, making it comfortable
to keep moving. So we wandered up and down
that sandy strip, footing it like dogs on the hunt for
a hole, and eying each other gloomily when we passed.</p>

<p>Early in the evening a big wooden building at the north
end was lighted up, and some of us gathered around
the windows and hung there under the eaves watching
the carriages drive up to the door to leave their freight.
There was a concert in the hall, and after it began I
crawled up into the arch of a window where I was out
of the rain and could hear the music. Before the concert
was over a watchman caught sight of me and
snaked me to the ground. He was making a round
of the building, stirring up the bums who had found
any hole out of the reach of the wind. So we began
once more that dreary, purposeless tramp to keep from
freezing.</p>

<p>"Kind of chilly!" a young fellow called out to me.</p>

<p>"Chillier before morning, all right," I growled back,
glad enough to hear a voice speaking to me as if it
expected an answer.</p>

<p>"First night?" he inquired, coming up close to me in
a friendly way. "'Tain't so bad&mdash;when it's warm and
the wind don't blow."</p>

<p>We walked on together slowly, as though we were
looking for something. When we came under the light
of the lamps in the avenue we eyed each other. My
tramp companion was a stout, honest-looking young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
fellow about my age. His loose-fitting black clothes
and collarless shirt made me think that he too had
come from the country recently.</p>

<p>"Been farming?" I ventured.</p>

<p>"Pine Lake, across there in Michigan&mdash;that's where I
come from. Hostetter, Ed Hostetter, that's my name."</p>

<p>We faced about and headed toward the lake without
any purpose. He told me his story while we dragged
ourselves back and forth along the high board fence
that guarded the railroad property. He had got tired
of working on his father's farm for nothing and had
struck out for the big city. Hostetter had a married aunt,
so he told me, living somewhere in Chicago, and he had
thought to stay with her until he could get a start on
fortune's road. But she had moved from her old address,
and his money had given out before he knew it. For the
last week he had been wandering about the streets, hunting
a job, and looking sharp for that aunt.</p>

<p>"We can't keep this up all night!" I observed when
his story had run out.</p>

<p>"Last night I found an empty over there in the yards,
but some of the railroad fellers got hold of me toward
morning and made me jump high."</p>

<p>A couple of tramps were crouching low beside the fence
just ahead of us. "Watch 'em!" my companion whispered.</p>

<p>Suddenly they burrowed down into the sand and disappeared.
We could hear their steps on the other side
of the fence; then a gruff voice. In a few moments
back they came, burrowing up from under the fence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what you get!" Ed grunted.</p>

<p>Well, in the end we had to make the best of it, and we
camped right there, hugging the fence for protection
against the east wind. We burrowed into the loose sand,
piling it up on the open side until we were well covered.
Now and then a train rushing past shook us awake with
its heavy tread. Toward morning there were fewer
trains, and though it began to mist pretty hard, and the
water trickled into our hole, I managed to get some
sleep.</p>

<p>At daylight we got up and shook ourselves, and then
wandered miserably into the silent streets of the downtown
district. Between us we had fifteen cents, and with
that we got some coffee and a piece of bread at a little
shanty stuck on the side of the river. A fat man with a
greasy, pock-marked face served us, and I can see him
now as he looked us over and winked to the policeman
who was loafing in the joint.</p>

<p>After our coffee we began the hunt for an odd job, and
Ed talked of his hopes of finding that aunt&mdash;Mrs. Pierson.
We kept together because we were so lonesome, I suppose,
and Ed was good company&mdash;jolly and happy-hearted.
That night we slept on the back porch of an
empty house 'way south, where the streets were broad,
and there were little strips of green all about the houses.
The owners of the large house we picked out must have
been away for the summer. Toward morning we heard
some one stirring around inside, opening and shutting
doors, and we made up our minds there were thieves at
work in the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Ed stayed to watch, while I ran out to the avenue to
get some help. It was a long time before I could find a
policeman, and when we got back to the house there was
Hostetter sitting on the curbstone hugging his belly. One
of the thieves had come out of the house the back way,
and when Ed tried to hold him had given him such a kick
that Ed was glad to let him go. The officer I had brought
evidently thought we were playing some game on him or
weren't quite straight ourselves, and he tried to take us
to the station. We gave him a lively chase for a couple
of blocks; the last we saw of him he was shaking his fist
at us and cussing loud enough to wake the dead.</p>

<p>That day was much like the one before, only worse.
The weather was mean and drizzly. I earned a quarter
lugging a valise across the city, and we ate that up at
breakfast. At noon we turned into one of the flashy
saloons on State Street. We hoped to be overlooked in
the crowd before the bar while we helped ourselves to the
crackers and salt fish. We were making out pretty well
when a man who was standing near the bar and drinking
nothing spied us and came over to the lunch table.</p>

<p>"Wet day," he observed sociably.</p>

<p>"That's about it," I replied cautiously, looking the
man over.</p>

<p>He wore a long black coat, a dirty light-colored waistcoat,
and a silk hat, underneath which little brown curls
sprouted out. He fed himself delicately out of the common
bowl, as if the free lunch didn't tempt his appetite.</p>

<p>"Seeing the town?" he asked next, looking pointedly
at Ed's dirty shoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some part of it, I reckon," Ed laughed.</p>

<p>"Looking for a job?"</p>

<p>"You bet we're looking!" Ed growled back. "Know
where we can find it?"</p>

<p>Before long we were on easy terms with the stranger.
He insisted on paying for beer all around, and on the
strength of that Ed and I made another raid on a platter
of beans. Dinner that night didn't look very promising.</p>

<p>"It seems to me I know of the very thing for you
young fellers," our friend finally remarked, and we
pricked up our ears.</p>

<p>He said he had a friend in one of the large stores on
State Street, who had found fine places for some young
men he had recommended. They were making big
money now. Ed's eyes began to glisten. But suddenly
another idea struck our good friend. He lowered his
voice and drew us to one side. Would one of us like
a fat job, where there wasn't much work except special
times&mdash;a gay kind of place, where we could see something
of life? Ed was pretty eager, but I rather suspected
what he was after.</p>

<p>"I guess the other place is more what we want," I
said.</p>

<p>"Ain't up to snuff just yet?" he giggled. "Wait a
week or two, and you will be as quick as the next one."</p>

<p>As we made no reply, and I was moving toward the
door, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure, it's stopped raining! Let's be moving up the
street, and see what my friend can do for you."</p>

<p>So we started up State Street with the man in the silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
hat. At the door of a big dry-goods store, where we had
tried unsuccessfully that morning to obtain work, he
remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll just look in here. I know a man in the gents'
underwear department, and p'r'aps he can help you."</p>

<p>I didn't think it very likely, for I hadn't much faith in
our smooth acquaintance. But there was nothing better
to do. So we all passed in through the heavy doors of
Steele &amp; Co.'s establishment. Even on that rainy afternoon
the place was pretty well filled; mostly with
women, who were bunched together at certain counters.
We had some trouble in following our guide, who
squirmed into the thick of every jam. I began to think
that, having talked big to two green young fellows, he
now wanted to give us the slip. But I determined, just
to tease him, he shouldn't get out of our sight as easily
as he thought to.</p>

<p>The "gents' underwear" department, as I happened to
have observed in the morning, was on the State Street
side, near the door which we had just entered. Nevertheless,
our friend was leading us away from that part
and seemed to prefer the most crowded aisles, where
"ladies' goods" were displayed. At the glove counter
there was a press of women who were trying to get near
a heap of ninety-eight-cent gloves. Our guide was just
ahead of us at this point, and near his elbow I noticed an
old gentleman and a young lady. The latter, who was
trying on a pair of gloves, kept asking the old gentleman
a string of questions. He was smiling at her without
taking the trouble to reply. The girl was pretty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
nicely dressed, and I suppose I must have looked at her
hard, for she suddenly glanced up at me and then turned
her back and faced the counter. As she turned I noticed
something white drop from her hand, and I pressed
closer to her to pick it up. It was a little handkerchief.
As I reached down I saw a thin hand stretch out around
the young lady's waist and then give a little jerk. I had
just straightened myself with the handkerchief in my
fingers when I heard the young lady exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father! My purse has gone!"</p>

<p>"Why, why!" the old man stammered. "Your purse
has gone? Where could it have gone to?"</p>

<p>Just then some one grabbed my arm, and a voice said
in my ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not so slick as that, young feller!"</p>

<p>A man who looked like an official of the store had
hold of me.</p>

<p>"Don't make any fuss, and hand over that lady's
purse," he added in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I haven't got her purse. I was just going to give her
this handkerchief, which I saw her drop," I protested,
holding up the silly thing I had picked from the floor.</p>

<p>"That's all right," the man said with a grin. "And
now hand over the purse, too."</p>

<p>He began to feel my pockets, and, of course, I resented
his familiarity, and, like a country jake, kicked up a
muss then and there. A crowd began to collect. The
floor-manager rushed up at this point, and between them
I was hustled across the store and into one of the private
offices. The first thing I heard when I got there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
was the old gentleman just behind me, stuttering, too
much excited to talk plain.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my daughter's purse! She just lost it!"</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said. "And I saw the fellow
who took it...."</p>

<p>"I saw this man take it," I heard the girl say to the
manager.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my daughter saw the thief take her purse,"
the old man put in excitedly.</p>

<p>"I was watching him all the time," said the man who
had laid hold of me first. "He came in at the State
Street entrance a few minutes ago with a green one and
an old sneak. I didn't think he had the time to pass
the stuff over."</p>

<p>I was cool now, and laughed as the manager and the
detective went through my pockets carefully.</p>

<p>"The old one's got the stuff fast enough," the detective
remarked disgustedly. "Shall we have this one
locked up, Mr. Marble?"</p>

<p>"You'll do it at your risk!" I put in loudly.</p>

<p>"Where's the young woman?" the manager demanded.</p>

<p>"It happened just while my daughter was buying a
pair of gloves," the old man began to chatter. "You
were asking me, my love...."</p>

<p>The young woman looked a little confused, I thought,
and not so sure of herself. But she answered the
manager's questions by saying promptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He must have taken it!"</p>

<p>"You saw him?" the detective questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I must have seen him&mdash;I saw him, of course!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe you could have seen me, ma'am," I said
with a grin, "for you had just turned your back on me."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" she asked triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I know it because when I first began to look at you,
you didn't like it, and so you turned your back on me
to show it."</p>

<p>"You know too much, young man," the manager
remarked. "You'll prosecute him?" he added, turning
to the old man.</p>

<p>"Prosecute? Why, yes, of course," he stammered;
"though, if he hasn't the purse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on, m'boy," the detective said to me. "You
and I'll take a stroll down the street and find a good
night's lodging for you."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That was before the day of patrol wagons. So the
detective locked his right arm securely in my left, and
in this intimate fashion we walked through the streets
to the police station.</p>

<p>When we reached that foul-smelling pen we were kept
waiting by a large "order" that had just been rounded
up from a gambling-house in the neighborhood. There
were about twenty men and women in this flock. They
were filing, one by one, before the desk-sergeant. I
had never heard such a family gathering of names. They
were all Smiths, Browns, and Joneses, and they all lived
a good way from town, out in the fifty-hundreds, where
there are many vacant lots. At the end of the file there
was a little unshaven Jew, who seemed very mad about
it all. He was the only one who had any money; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
gave up a fat roll of bills that took the officer some time
to count.</p>

<p>"I know who did this!" the Jew sputtered at the
man behind the desk. "And I can make it hot for some
of youse, all right."</p>

<p>"That's good," the sergeant replied pleasantly. "Another
time you'll have the sense to know when you are
well off."</p>

<p>I thought this was fatherly advice addressed to the
Jew for his moral health. I congratulated myself that
I had fallen into clean hands. So when my turn came,
I said to the desk-sergeant confidentially:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am quite innocent!"</p>

<p>"Is that so, m'son?" he remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"They haven't any right to arrest me. I was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course! Keep all that for his Honor
to-morrow morning. What's your name, m'son?"</p>

<p>"E.V. Harrington," I replied quite innocently.</p>

<p>"And where do you hail from?"</p>

<p>"Jasonville, Indiana."</p>

<p>It did not occur to me then that, guilty or innocent,
it made no difference after I had given my real name
and home. Thanks to the enterprise of metropolitan
journalism, the folks in Jasonville, Indiana, would be
reading at their breakfast to-morrow morning all about
how Van Harrington had been taken up as a thief.</p>

<p>"Here!" the fat sergeant called out to one of the
officers, after I had handed over to his care the few odds
and ends that I still had about me; "show the gent from
Indiany to number twelve."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

 <p class="caption"><i>Feeling that I had come to the end of
things in Chicago mighty quick.</i></p></div>

<p>There was a greasy
bench at one end of
number twelve, where
I sat myself down, feeling
that I had come to
the end of things in
Chicago mighty quick.
A measly gas-jet above
the door showed what
a stinking hole I had
got myself into. I
could hear the gambling
party across the
way, laughing and talking,
taking their lot
rather easily. Pretty
soon a man was put
into the cell next mine.
He kept groaning about
his head. "My head!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
he would say, "oh, my head! My head! oh, my head!"
until I thought my own head was going wrong.</p>

<p>I wondered what had become of Hostetter. Apparently
he had cleared out when he saw his chance friend getting
into trouble. Perhaps he thought I had been working
with our smooth acquaintance all along. Then I thought
what a fool I had been to give my real name and home
to the desk-sergeant. To-morrow the wise ones down in
Jasonville would be calling Van Harrington bad names
all over again, and thinking how clever they had been.</p>

<p>Some bad-smelling mess was shoved at me for supper,
but I had no stomach for food, good or bad. The jail
quieted down after a time, but I couldn't sleep. My mind
was full of the past, of everything that had happened to
me from the beginning. Only forty-eight hours before I
had been tramping my way into the city, as keen as a
hungry steer for all the glory I saw there ahead of me
under the bank of smoke that was Chicago. Boylike, I
had looked up at the big packing-houses, the factories,
the tall elevators that I passed, and thought how one day
I should be building my fortune out of them as others
had built theirs before me. And the end of that boyish
dream was this bed in a jail!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The next morning they hustled us all into court. I
was crowded into the pen along with some of the numerous
Smiths and Joneses who hadn't been able to secure
bail the night before. These were disposed of first in the
way of routine business, together with a few drunks
and disorderlies. There were also in the pen some sickly-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>looking
fellows who had been taken up for smoking opium
in a Chinese cellar, a woman in whose house there had
been a robbery, and a well-dressed man with a bandage
over one eye. He must have been my neighbor of the
bad head.</p>

<p>The court room was pretty well jammed with these
prisoners, the police officers, and a few loafers. The air
smelled like a sewer, and the windows were foul with
dirt. The judge was a good-looking, youngish man, with
a curling black mustache, and he wore a diamond-studded
circlet around his necktie. Behind the judge on the
platform sat the young woman whose purse I was accused
of stealing, and her father. She saw me when I was
brought into the pen, but tried not to let me know it,
looking away all the time.</p>

<p>When I arrived on the scene the judge was administering
an oath to a seedy-looking man, who kissed eagerly
the filthy Bible and began to mumble something in a
hurry to the judge.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that pipe dream," his Honor interrupted
pleasantly. "Now, tell me the straight story of what
you have been doing since you were here last week."</p>

<p>"You insult me, Judge," the prisoner replied haughtily.
"I'm an educated man, a graduate of a great institution
of learning. You know your Horace, Judge?"</p>

<p>"Not so well as the revised statutes of the state of
Illinois," his Honor snapped back with what I thought
was a lack of respect for learning. "Two months.
Next!"</p>

<p>"Why, Judge&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a titter in the court room as the graduate of
a great university was led from the pen. His Honor,
wearing the same easy smile, was already listening to the
next case. He flecked off a stray particle of soot that
had lodged on the big pink in his buttonhole as he
remarked casually:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that so? Twenty-five dollars. It will be fifty the
next time."</p>

<p>The judge nodded blandly to the prisoner and turned
to my neighbor of the night, the man who had had so
much trouble with his head. I was getting very uneasy.
That smiling gentleman up there on the bench seemed to
have his mind made up about most folks beforehand, and
it didn't seem to be favorably inclined this morning.
I was beginning to wonder how many months he had
me down for already. It didn't add to my peace of mind
to see him chatting genially with the old gentleman
and his daughter as he listened to the poor criminals at
the bar.</p>

<p>His Honor went on disposing of the last cases at a
rapid rate, with a smile, a nod, a joke&mdash;and my time
was coming nearer. The sweat rolled down my cheeks.
I couldn't keep my eyes off the young lady's face; somehow
I felt that she was my only hope of safety. Finally
the judge leaned back in his chair and smelled at his pink,
as if he had 'most finished his morning's work.</p>

<p>The clerk called, "Edward V. Harrington." I jumped.</p>

<p>"Well, Edward?" the judge inquired pleasantly as
I stood before him. "The first time we have had the
pleasure, I believe?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>I mumbled something, and the store detective began
to tell his story.</p>

<p>"Is that it, Doctor?" the judge asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Why, I suppose so&mdash;I don't know. He was caught
in the act, wasn't he?" Then, as the old man sat down,
he added peevishly: "At least, that's what my daughter
says, and she ought to know. It was her purse, and she
got me down here this morning."</p>

<p>"How about it, miss?" the judge asked quickly,
wheeling his chair the other way and smiling at the
young lady. "Did you see the prisoner here take your
purse?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;" She was just going to say
"yes" when her eyes caught mine for a moment, and
she hesitated. "No, I didn't exactly see him, but&mdash;"
her look swept haughtily over my head. "But he was
very close to me and was stooping down just as I felt
a jerk at my belt. And then the purse was gone. He
must have taken it!"</p>

<p>"Stooping to beauty, possibly?" the judge suggested.</p>

<p>"Stooping to pick up the lady's handkerchief, which I
saw her drop," I ventured to put in, feeling that in another
moment I should find myself blown into prison
with a joke.</p>

<p>"Oh! So you were picking up the lady's handkerchief?
Very polite, I am sure!" His Honor glared
at me for an instant for the first time. "And you
thought you might as well take the purse, too? For a
keepsake, eh?"</p>

<p>He had wheeled around to face me. A sentence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
on his lips. I could feel it coming, and hadn't an idea
how to keep it back. I looked helplessly at the young
woman. Just as his Honor opened his mouth to speak,
she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wait a moment! I am not sure&mdash;he doesn't look
bad. I thought, Judge, you could tell whether he had
really taken my purse," she ended reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Do you consider me a mind reader, miss?" the judge
retorted, suspending that sentence in mid-air.</p>

<p>"Let him say something! Let him tell his story,"
the young lady urged. "Perhaps he isn't guilty, after
all. I am sure he doesn't look it."'</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah!" the old gentleman gasped in astonishment.
"You said this morning at breakfast that
you were sure he had stolen it."</p>

<p>Here the detective put in his oar.</p>

<p>"I know him and the one that was with him&mdash;they're
old sneaks, your Honor."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" I said, finding my tongue at last.</p>

<p>"Good!" the judge exclaimed appreciatively. "I am
inclined to think so, too, Edward," he went on, adjusting
his diamond circlet with one finger. "This young lady
thinks you have a story of your own. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, and a straight one," I answered, plucking
up my courage.</p>

<p>"Of course," he grunted sarcastically. "Well, let's
have it, but make it short."</p>

<p>It did sound rather lame when I came to tell what
I had done with myself since I had entered the city.
When I got to that part about the house where Ed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
I had been disturbed by thieves, the old gentleman
broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! That must be the Wordens' house.
The officer said there were two suspicious characters who
ran away up the boulevard. This fellow must be one
of them. Of course he took the purse! You know the
Wordens, don't you, Judge?"</p>

<p>His Honor merely nodded to the old gentleman,
smiled at the young lady, and said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, young man! Tell us why you left home in
the first place."</p>

<p>I got red all over again at this invitation, and was
taken with a new panic.</p>

<p>"Who are your folks? What's the name of the
place?" the judge asked encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Jasonville, Indiana."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Jasonville, Edward?" he
asked more sharply. "Why do you blush for it?"</p>

<p>"I had rather not tell with all these folks around,"
I answered, looking at the young lady.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>His Honor must have found something in my case a
little out of his ordinary experience, for he took me back
into his own room. He got me started on my story, and
one thing led to another. His manner changed all of a
sudden: he no longer tried to be smart, and he seemed
to have plenty of time. After that long night in the jail
I wanted to talk. So I told his Honor just how it had
been with me from the beginning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="chap">JASONVILLE, INDIANA</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The Harringtons&mdash;The village magnate&mdash;A young hoodlum&mdash;On
the road to school&mdash;The first woman&mdash;Disgrace, and a girl's
will&mdash;An unfortunate coincidence&mdash;In trouble again&mdash;May
loses faith&mdash;The end of Jasonville&mdash;Discharged&mdash;A loan&mdash;Charity&mdash;The
positive young lady hopes I shall start right&mdash;The
lake front once more&mdash;I preach myself a good sermon</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The Harringtons were pretty well known in Greene
County, Indiana. Father moved to Jasonville just after
the war, when the place was not much more than a cross-roads
with a prospect of a railroad sometime. Ours was
the first brick house, built after the kind he and mother
used to know back in York State. And he set up the
largest general store in that district and made money.
Then he lost most of it when the oil boom first came.</p>

<p>Mother and he set great store by education,&mdash;if father
hadn't gone to the war he wouldn't have been keeping a
country store,&mdash;and they helped start the first township
high school in our part of the state. And he sent Will,
my older brother, and me to the Methodist school at
Eureka, which was the best he could do for us. There
wasn't much learning to be had in Eureka "College,"
however; the two or three old preachers and women who
composed the faculty were too busy trying to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
boys from playing cards and smoking or chewing to
teach us much.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was a bit of a hoodlum as a boy, anyway.
The trouble started with the judge&mdash;Judge Sorrell. He
was a local light, who held a mortgage on 'most everything
in town (including our store&mdash;after father went
into oil). We boys had always heard at home how hard
and mean the judge was, and dishonest, too; for in some
of the oil deals he had tricked folks out of their property.
It wasn't so strange, then, that we youngsters
took liberties with the judge's belongings that the older
folks did not dare to. The judge's fine stock used to
come in from the field done up, raced to death, and the
orchard by the creek just out of town (which had belonged
to us once) rarely brought a good crop to maturity.
We made ourselves believe that the judge didn't
really own it, and treated him as a trespasser. So one
night, when the judge made a hasty visit to our house
after one of the "raids," my father found me in bed
with a wet suit of clothes on, which I had been forced to
sacrifice in the creek. The end of that lark was that
father had to pay a good sum for my private interpretation
of the laws of property, and I spent the rest of the
summer on a farm doing a man's work.</p>

<p>Perhaps if it hadn't been for that ducking in the
river and what followed, I might have come out just a
plain thief. While I was sweating on that farm I saw
the folly of running against common notions about property.
I came to the conclusion that if I wanted what my
neighbor considered to be his, I must get the law to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the business for me. For the first time it dawned on me
how wonderful is that system which shuts up one man in
jail for taking a few dollars' worth of truck that doesn't
belong to him, and honors the man who steals his
millions&mdash;if he robs in the legal way! Yes, the old
judge knocked some good worldly sense into me.</p>

<p>(Nevertheless, old Sorrell needn't have hounded me
after I came back to Jasonville, and carried his malice to
the point of keeping me from getting a job when I was
hoping to make a fair start so that I could ask May
Rudge to marry me. But all that was some time later.)</p>

<p>May was one of that handful of young women who in
those days stood being sneered at for wanting to go
to college with their brothers. We were in the same
classes at Eureka two years before I noticed her much.
She was little and pale and delicate&mdash;with serious, cold
gray eyes, and a mouth that was always laughing at you.
I can see to-day the very spot where she stood when I
first spoke to her. Good weather I used to drive over
from father's to Eureka, and one spring morning I happened
to drive by the Rudge farm on my way to school
instead of taking the pike, which was shorter. There
was a long level stretch of road straightaway between
two pieces of green meadow, and there, ahead of me, I
saw the girl, walking steadily, looking neither to the
right nor to the left. I slowed up with the idea that
she might give me a nod or a word; but she kept her
pace as though she were thinking of things too far off
to notice a horse and buggy on the road. Somehow I
wanted to make her speak. Pretty soon I said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Won't you ride to school with me, Miss May?"</p>

<p>Then she turned her head, not the least flustered like
other girls, and looked me square in the eye for a minute.
I knew she was wondering what made me speak to her
then, for the boys at school never took notice of the college
girls. But she got into the buggy and sat prim and
solemn by my side. We jogged along between the
meadows, which were bright with flowers and the soft,
green grass of spring. The big timber along the roadside
and between the pasture lands had just leaved out,
and the long branches hung daintily in the misty morning
air. All of a sudden I felt mighty happy to be
there with her. I think her first words were,&mdash;"Do
you come this way often?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be coming this way oftener now," I
made bold to answer.</p>

<p>Her lips trembled in a little ironical smile, and the
least bit of red sprang into her white face. I said, "It
isn't as short as the pike, but it is a prettier road."</p>

<p>The smile deepened, and I had it on my tongue to
add, "I shall be coming this way every morning if you
will ride with me." But I was afraid of that smiling
mouth.</p>

<p>(Of course I didn't tell his Honor all this, but I add
it now, together with other matters that concern me and
belong here. It will help to explain what happened
later.)</p>

<p>So that fine spring morning, when I was seventeen, I
first took note of what a woman is. The rest of that
year I used to drive the prim little girl back and forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
between her father's farm and school. I was no scholar
like her, and she never went about with the other girls
to parties. She wasn't in the least free and easy with
the boys. In those days most girls didn't think much
of a fellow who wouldn't take his chances to kiss them
when he could. Evenings, when we called, we used to
pull the parlor door to and sit holding hands with the
young woman of our admiration. And no harm ever
came of it that I know: most of those girls made good
wives when the time came, for all they were easy and
tender and ready to make love in the days of their
youth.</p>

<p>But once, when I tried to put my arm about May
Rudge, as we were driving along the lonely road, she
turned and looked at me out of those cold gray eyes.
Her mouth rippled in that little ironical way, as if she
were laughing down in her mind. She never said a
word or pulled away from me, but I didn't care to
go on.</p>

<p>May gave me ambition, and she made me want to be
steady and good, though she never said anything about
it. But now and then I would break away and get
myself into some fool scrape. Such was the time when
I came back from a Terre Haute party pretty light-headed,
and went with some others to wake up the old
Methodist president of the college. I don't remember
what happened then, but the next morning at chapel the
old boy let loose on "wine and wantoning," and called
me by name. I knew that I had done for myself at
Eureka, and I was pretty mad to be singled out for repro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>bation
from all the offenders. I got up from my seat and
walked out while the school stared. As I was getting my
horse from the place where I kept it, May Rudge came
into the yard.</p>

<p>"You aren't going this way?" she demanded quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't see as there's much use waiting for bouquets."</p>

<p>"You aren't going
without apologizing!"
she flashed out.</p>

<p>To tell the truth,
that had never occurred
to me. It
seemed she cared less
for the disgrace than
for the way I took it.
So in the end, before
I left town, I drove
up to the president's
house, apologized, and
got my dismissal in
due form, and was
told I should go to
hell unless I was converted
straightway.
Then May drove down
the street with me in
face of the whole school, who contrived to be there to
see my departure.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>I believe she would have let me kiss her

<p>"I guess this ends my education, and being a lawyer,
and all that," I said gloomily, as we drew near the Rudge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
farm. "Dad will never forgive this. He thinks rum is
the best road to hell, the same as the old preacher. He
won't sell a glass of cider in the store."</p>

<p>"There are other kinds of work," she answered. "You
can show them just the same you know what's right."</p>

<p>"But you'll never marry a
man who isn't educated," I
said boldly.</p>

<p>"I'll never marry a man who
hasn't principles&mdash;and religion,"
she replied without a
blush.</p>

<p>"So I must be good and
pious, as well as educated?"</p>

<p>"You must be a man"&mdash;and
her lips curved ironically&mdash;"and
now you are just a boy."</p>

<p>But I held her hand when I
helped her from the buggy, and
I believe she would
have let me kiss her
had I wanted to then.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;"><a name="i036" id="i036"></a>
<img src="images/i036.jpg" width="225" height="384" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Earning mighty little but my keep.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Father and mother
took my expulsion from
school very hard, as I
expected. Father especially&mdash;who had begun to brag
somewhat at the store about my being a lawyer and
beating the judge out&mdash;was so bitter that I told him
if he would give me fifty dollars I would go off somewhere
and never trouble him again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ask me to give you fifty dollars to go to hell
with!" he shouted out.</p>

<p>"Put me in the store, then, and let me earn it. Give
me the same money you give Will."</p>

<p>But father didn't want me around the store for folks
to see. So I had to go out to a farm once more, to a
place that father was working on shares with a Swede.
I spent the better part of two years on that farm, living
with the old Swede, and earning mighty little but my
keep. For father gave me a dollar now and then, but no
regular wages. I could get sight of May only on a Sunday.
She was teaching her first school in another county.
Father and mother Rudge had never liked me: they
looked higher for May than to marry a poor farm-hand,
who had a bad name in the town. My brother Will,
who was a quiet, church-going fellow, had learned his
way to the Rudge place by this time, and the old
people favored him.</p>

<p>After a while I heard of a chance in a surveyor's office
at Terre Haute, but old Sorrell, who had more business
than any ten men in that part of the country, met the
surveyor on the train, and when I reached the office there
wasn't any job for me. That night, when I got back
from Terre Haute, I told my folks that I was going to
Chicago. The next day I asked my father again for
some money. Mother answered for him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will don't ask us for money. It won't be fair to
him."</p>

<p>"So he's to have the store and my girl too," I said
bitterly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"May Rudge isn't the girl to marry a young man
who's wild."</p>

<p>"I'll find that out for myself!"</p>

<p>Always having had a pretty fair opinion of myself,
I found it hard to be patient and earn good-will
by my own deserts. So I said rather foolishly to
father:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you give me a few dollars to start me with?
I have earned it all right, and I am asking you for the
last time."</p>

<p>It was a kind of threat, and I am sorry enough for it
now. I suspect he hadn't the money, for things were
going badly with him. He answered pretty warmly that
I should wait a long time before he gave me another dollar
to throw away. I turned on my heel without a word
to him or mother, and went out of the house with the
resolve not to return.</p>

<p>But before I left Jasonville to make my plunge into
the world I would see May Rudge. I wanted to say to
her: "Which will you have? Choose now!" So I
turned about and started for the Rudge farm, which
was about a mile from the town, beyond the old place
on the creek that used to belong to us. Judge Sorrell
had put up a large new barn on the place, where he kept
some fine blooded stock that he had been at considerable
expense to import. I had never been inside the barn,
and as I passed it that afternoon, it came into my mind,
for no particular reason, to turn in at the judge's farm
and go by the new building. Maybe I thought the old
judge would be around somewhere, and I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the chance before I left Jasonville to tell him what I
thought of his dirty, sneaking ways.</p>

<p>But there was no one in the big barn, apparently, or
anywhere on the place, and after looking about for a
little I went on to May's. I came up to the Rudge farm
from the back, having taken a cut across the fields.</p>

<p>As I drew near the house I saw Will and May sitting
under an apple tree talking. I walked on slowly, my
anger somehow rising against them both. There was
nothing wrong in their being there&mdash;nothing at all;
but I was ready to fire at the first sign. By the looks
of it, mother was right: they were already sweethearts.
Will seemed to have something very earnest to say to
May. He took hold of one of her hands, and she didn't
draw it away at once.... There wasn't anything more
to keep me in Jasonville.</p>

<p>I kept right on up the country road, without much
notion of where I was going to, too hot and angry to
think about anything but those two under the apple
tree. I had not gone far before I heard behind me a
great rushing noise, like the sudden sweep of a tornado,
and then a following roar. I looked up across the fields,
and there was the judge's fine new barn one mass of
red flame and black smoke. It was roaring so that I
could hear it plainly a quarter of a mile away. Naturally,
I started to run for the fire, and ran hard all the
way across the fields. By the time I got there some men
from town had arrived and were rushing around crazily.
But they hadn't got out the live stock, and there was no
chance now to save a hen. The judge drove up pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ently,
and we all stood around and stared at the fire.
After a time I began to think it was time for me to move
on if I was to get to any place that night. I slipped
off and started up the road once more. I hadn't gone
far, however, before I was overtaken by a buggy in
which was one of the men who had been at the fire.</p>

<p>"Where be yer goin', Van?" he asked peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I am called on to tell you, Sam," I
answered back.</p>

<p>"Yes, you be," he said more kindly. "I guess you'll
have to jump right in here, anyways, and ride back with
me. The judge wants to ask you a few questions about
this here fire."</p>

<p>"I don't answer any of the judge's questions!" I replied
sharply enough, not yet seeing what the man was
after. But he told me bluntly enough that I was suspected
of setting fire to the barn, and drove me back to
the town, where I stayed in the sheriff's custody until
my uncle came late that night and bailed me out. Will
was with him. Father didn't want me to come home,
so Will let me understand. Neither he nor my uncle
thought I was innocent, but they hoped that there might
not be enough evidence to convict me. Some one on the
creek road had seen me going past the barn a little time
before the fire was discovered, and that was the only
ground for suspecting me.</p>

<p>The next morning I got my uncle (who wouldn't trust
me out of his sight) to drive me over to the Rudge place.
He sat in the team while I went up to the house and
knocked. I was feeling pretty desperate in my mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
but if May would only believe my story, I shouldn't care
about the others. She would understand quick enough
why I never appeared at the farm the day before. Old
man Rudge came
to the door, and
when he saw
me, he drew back
and asked me
what my business
was.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 40%;"><a name="i041" id="i041"></a>
<img src="images/i041.jpg" width="225" height="363" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>I guess she don't want much to see you.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"I want to see
May," I said.</p>

<p>"I guess she
don't want much
to see you."</p>

<p>"I must see
her."</p>

<p>The sound
of our voices
brought Mrs.
Rudge from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"Mother," old
Rudge said, "Van
wants to see
May."</p>

<p>"Well, Cyrus, it won't do any harm, I guess."</p>

<p>When May came to the door she waited for me to speak.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you, May," I said slowly, "that I
didn't have any hand in burning the judge's barn."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want to believe you did," she said.</p>

<p>"But you do all the same!" I cried sharply.</p>

<p>"Every one says you did, Van," she answered doubtfully.</p>

<p>"So you think I could do a mean, sneaky thing like
that?" I replied hotly, and added bitterly: "And then
not have sense enough to get out of the way! Well, I
know what this means: you and Will have put your
heads together. You're welcome to him!"</p>

<p>"You've no reason to say such things, Van!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There ain't no use in you talking with my girl, Harrington,"
put in Rudge, who had come back to the door.
"And I don't want you coming here any more."</p>

<p>"How about that, May?" I asked. "Do you tell me
to go?"</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, and she looked at me more kindly.
Perhaps in another moment she would have answered
and not failed me. But hot and heady as I was by
nature, and smarting from all that had happened, I
wanted a ready answer: I would not plead for
myself.</p>

<p>"So you won't take my word for it?" I said, turning
away.</p>

<p>"The word of a drunkard and a good-for-nothing!"
the old man fired after me.</p>

<p>"Oh, father! don't," I heard May say. Then perhaps
she called my name. But I was at the gate, and
too proud to turn back.</p>

<p>I was discharged the next week. Although there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
nothing against me except the fact that I had been seen
about the barn previous to the fire, and the well-known
enmity between me and the judge, it would have gone
hard with me had it not been for the fact that in the
ruins of the burned barn they found the remains of an
old farm-hand, who had probably wandered in there while
drunk and set the place on fire with his pipe.</p>

<p>When I was released my uncle said the folks were
ready to have me back home; but without a word I
started north on the county road in the direction of the
great city.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"So," said his Honor, when I had finished my story
in the dingy chamber of the police court, "you want me
to believe that you really had no hand in firing that barn
any more than you took this lady's purse?"</p>

<p>But he smiled to himself, at his own penetration, I
suppose, and when we were back in the court room that
dreaded sentence fell from his lips like a shot,&mdash;"Officer,
the prisoner is discharged."</p>

<p>"I knew he was innocent!" the young lady exclaimed
the next instant.</p>

<p>"But, Judge, where is the purse and my friend Worden's
fur coat?" the old gentleman protested.</p>

<p>"You don't see them about him, do you, Doctor?" the
judge inquired blandly. Then he turned to me: "Edward,
I think that you have told me an honest story.
I hope so."</p>

<p>He took a coin from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Here's a dollar, my boy. Buy a ticket for as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
this will take you, and walk the rest of the way
home."</p>

<p>"I guess I have come to Chicago to stay," I answered.
"They aren't breaking their hearts over losing me
down home."</p>

<p>"Well, my son, as you think best. In this glorious
Republic it is every man's first privilege to take his own
road to hell. But, at any rate, get a good dinner to start
on. We don't serve first-class meals here."</p>

<p>"I'll return this as soon as I can," I said, picking up
the coin.</p>

<p>"The sooner the better; and the less we see of each
other in the future, the better, eh?"</p>

<p>I grinned, and started for the door through which I had
been brought into court, but an officer pointed to another
door that led to the street. As I made for it I passed
near the young lady. She called to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mister, mister, what will you do now?"</p>

<p>"Get something to eat first, and then look for another
purse, perhaps," I replied.</p>

<p>She blushed very prettily.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I accused you, but you were looking at me
so hard just then&mdash;I thought.... I want you to take
this!"</p>

<p>She tried to give me a bill rolled up in a little wad.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," I said, moving off.</p>

<p>"But you may need it. Every one says it's so hard to
find work."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't take money from a woman."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She blushed again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she ran to the old gentleman, who was talking
to the judge, and got from him a little black memorandum-book.</p>

<p class="caption">"<i>I want you to take this.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"You see, my cards were all in the purse. But
there!" she said, writing down her name and address
on the first page.
"You will know
now where to
come in case
you need help or
advice."</p>

<p>"Thank you,"
I replied, taking
the book.</p>

<p>"I do so want
to help you to
start right and
become a good
man," she said
timidly. "Won't
you try to show
your friends that
they were mistaken
in you?"</p>

<p>She turned her
eyes up at me
appealingly as if
she were asking it as a favor to her. I felt foolish and
began to laugh, but stopped, for she looked hurt.</p>

<p>"I guess, miss, it don't work quite that way. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
course, I mean to start fresh&mdash;but I shan't do it even
for your sake. All the same, when you see me next it
won't be in a police station."</p>

<p>"That's right!" she exclaimed, beaming at me with
her round blue eyes. "I should like to feel that I hadn't
hurt you&mdash;made you worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't worry about that, miss. I guess I'm
not much worse off for a night in the police station."</p>

<p>She held out her hand and I took it.</p>

<p>"Sarah! Sarah!" the old gentleman called as we were
shaking hands. He seemed rather shocked, but the
judge looked up at us and smiled quizzically.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Outside it was a warm, pleasant day; the wind was
blowing merrily through the dirty street toward the blue
lake. For the moment I did not worry over what was to
come next. The first thing I did was to get a good meal.</p>

<p>After that refreshment I sauntered forth in the direction
of the lake front&mdash;the most homelike place I could
think of. The roar of the city ran through my head like
the clatter of a mill. I seemed to be just a feeble atom
of waste in the great stream of life flowing around me.</p>

<p>When I reached the desolate strip of weeds and sand
between the avenue and the railroad, the first relay of
bums was beginning to round up for the night. The
sight of their tough faces filled me with a new disgust;
I turned back to the busy avenue, where men and women
were driving to and fro with plenty to do and think, and
then and there I turned on myself and gave myself a good
cussing. Here I was more than twenty, and just a plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
fool, and had been ever since I could remember. When
I had rid myself of several layers of conceit it began to
dawn on me that this was a world where one had to step
lively if he wasn't to join the ranks of the bums back
there in the sand. That was the most valuable lot of
thinking I ever did in my life. It took the sorehead
feeling of wronged genius out of me for good and all.
Pretty soon I straightened my back and started for the
city to find somewhere a bite of food and a roof to cover
my head.</p>

<p>And afterward there would be time to think of conquering
the world!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello! Here you be! Ain't I glad I found yer this
soon," and Ed's brown eyes were looking into mine. His
seemed to me just then about the best face in the world.
"Seems though I was bound to be chasin' some one in
this city!" he shouted, grabbing me by the arm. "But
I've found all of 'em now."</p>

<p>He had missed me at the police station by a few minutes,
and I had left no address. After looking up and down
a few streets near by, Ed had thought of lying in wait for
me on the lake front, feeling that unless some extraordinary
good luck had happened to me I should bring up at
that popular resort. He had not seen the little incident
when the detective grabbed me in the great store, for just
at that moment his attention had been attracted to a girl
at one of the counters, who had called him by name.
The girl, who was selling perfumes and tooth-washes,
turned out to be his cousin Lou, his Aunt Pierson's
younger daughter. After the surprise of their meeting
Ed had looked for me, and the floor-walker told them of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
my misfortune. Then the cousin had made Ed go home
with her. Mrs. Pierson, it seems, took in boarders in
her three-story-and-basement house on West Van Buren
Street. She and the two girls had given Ed a warm
welcome, and for the first time in many days he had had
the luxury of a bed, which had caused him to oversleep,
and miss me at the station.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i049" id="i049"></a>
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="450" height="372" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>Ma Pierson's.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>All this I learned as we walked westward toward Ed's
new home. At first I was a little shy about putting
another burden on the boy's relations. But my friend
would not hear of letting me go. When Ed tucked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
arm under mine and hauled me along with country
heartiness, saying I could share his bed and he had a job
in view for us both, I felt as though the sun had begun
to shine all over again that day. Through all the accidents
of many years I have never forgotten that kindness,
and my heart warms afresh when I stop to think
how Ed grabbed my arm and pulled me along with him
off those city streets....</p>

<p>So it happened at dinner-time that night I found myself
in the basement dining room and made my first bow
to some people who were to be near me for a number of
years&mdash;one or two of them for life. I can remember
just how they all looked sitting about the table, which
was covered with a mussed red table-cloth, and lit by a
big, smelly oil lamp. Pa Pierson sat at the head of the
table, an untidy, gray-haired old man, who gave away
his story in every line of his body. He had made some
money in his country store back in Michigan; but the
ambition to try his luck in the city had ruined him. He
had gone broke on crockery. He was supposed to be
looking for work, but he spent most of his time in this
basement dining room, warming himself at the stove and
reading the boarders' papers.</p>

<p>The girls and the boy, Dick, paid him even less respect
than they did their mother. They were all the kind of
children that don't tolerate much incompetence in their
parents. Dick was a putty-faced, black-haired cub, who
scrubbed blackboards and chewed gum in a Board of
Trade man's office. Neither he nor his two sisters, who
were also working downtown, contributed much to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
house, and except that now and then Grace, the older
one, would help clean up the dishes in a shamefaced way,
or bring the food on the table when the meal was extra
late or she wanted to get out for the evening, not one of
the three ever raised a finger to help with the work. The
whole place, from kitchen to garret, fell on poor old Ma
Pierson, and the boarders were kinder to her than her
own children. Lank and stooping, short-sighted, with
a faded, tired smile, she came and went between the
kitchen and the dining room, cooking the food and serving
it, washing the dishes, scrubbing the floors, and
making the beds&mdash;I never saw her sit down to the table
with us except one Christmas Day, when she was too
sick to cook. She took her fate like an Indian, and died
on the steps of her treadmill.</p>

<p>There were two other regular boarders besides myself
and Ed&mdash;a man and a woman. The latter, Miss Hillary
Cox, was cashier in the New Enterprise Market, not far
from the house. She was rather short and stout, with
thick ropes of brown hair that she piled on her head in a
solid mass to make her look tall. She had bright little
eyes, and her rosy face showed that she had not been
long in the city.</p>

<p>The man was a long, lean, thin-faced chap, somewhat
older than I was. His name was Jaffrey Slocum; he
was studying law and doing stenographic work in a law
office in the city. When I first looked at him I thought
that he would push his way over most of the rocks in the
road&mdash;and he did. Slocum was a mighty silent man,
but little passed before his eyes without his knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
what it meant. I learned later that he came from a good
Maine family, and had been to college in the East. And
he had it much on his mind to do several things with his
life&mdash;the first of which was to buy back the old home in
Portland, and put his folks there where they belonged.
Old Sloco, we called him! For all his slow, draggy ways
he had pounds of pressure on the gauge. He and I have
fought through some big fights since then, and there's
no man I had as soon have beside me in a scrap as that
thin-faced, scrawny-necked old chip of Maine granite.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When Ed introduced me at the table, Grace made a
place beside her, and her sister Lou hospitably shoved
over a plate of stew. Then Lou smiled at me and opened
fire:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We read all about you in the papers this morning,
Mr. Harrington!"</p>

<p>"Heh, heh!" Pa Pierson cackled.</p>

<p>"Say, Lou, I don't call that polite," Grace protested
in an affected tone.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me," I called out. "I guess I'm a public
character, anyway."</p>

<p>"What did the lady say when she found she was
wrong?" Lou went on. "I should think she'd want to
die, doing a mean thing like that."</p>

<p>"Did she give you any little souvenir of the occasion?"
Dick inquired.</p>

<p>"If they are real nice folks, I should think they'd try
to make it up some way," Grace added.</p>

<p>"But what we want to know first," Slocum drawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gravely, "is, did you take the purse, and, if so, where
did you put it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Slocum!" Miss Cox sputtered, not catching
the joke. "What a thing to insinuate! I am sure
Mr. Harrington doesn't look like that&mdash;any one could
see he wouldn't <i>steal</i>."</p>

<p>In this way they passed me back and forth, up and
down the table, until the last scrap of meat was gnawed
from the bone. Then they sniffed at Jasonville. Where
was it? What did I do there? Why did I come to the
city? Miss Cox was the sharpest one at the questions.
She wanted to know all about my father's store. She
had already got Ed a place as delivery clerk in the Enterprise
Market, and there might be an opening in the same
store for me. I could see that there would be a place all
right if I met the approval of the smart little cashier.
It has never been one of my faults to be backward with
women,&mdash;all except May,&mdash;and as Miss Hillary Cox was
far from unprepossessing, I fixed my attention on her
for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>The Pierson girls tired of me quickly enough, as they
had already tired of Ed. Lou soon ceased to smile at
me and open her eyes in her silly stare when I made a
remark. After dinner she went out on the steps to wait
for a beau, who was to take her to a dance. Grace sat
awhile to chaff with the lawyer's clerk. He seemed to
make fun of her, but I could see that he liked her pretty
well. (It must be a stupid sort of woman, indeed, who
can't get hold of a man when he has nothing to do after
his work except walk the streets or read a book!) There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was nothing bad in either of the girls: they were just
soft, purring things, shut up all day long, one in a big
shop and the other in a dentist's office. Of course, when
they got home, they were frantic for amusement, dress,
the theatre&mdash;anything bright and happy; anything that
would make a change. They had a knack of stylish
dressing, and on the street looked for all the world like a
rich man's daughters. Nothing bad in either one, then&mdash;only
that kind gets its eyes opened too late!...</p>

<p>The next morning I stepped around to the Enterprise
Market, and Miss Cox introduced me to the proprietors.
They were two brothers, sharp-looking young men, up-to-date
in their ideas, the cashier had told me, and bound
to make the Enterprise the largest market on the West
Side. Miss Cox had evidently said a good word for me,
and that afternoon I found myself tying up parcels and
taking orders at ten dollars a week.</p>

<p>Not a very brilliant start on fortune's road, but I was
glad enough to get it. The capable cashier kept a
friendly eye on me, and saved me from getting into
trouble. Before long I had my pay raised, and then
raised again. Ed had taken hold well, too, and was
given more pay. He was more content with his job than
I was. The work suited him&mdash;the driving about the
city streets, the rush at the market mornings, the big
crates of country stuff that came smelling fresh from the
fields. The city was all that he had hoped to find it.
Not so to me&mdash;I looked beyond; but I worked hard and
took my cues from the pretty cashier, who grew more
friendly every day. We used to go to places in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
evenings,&mdash;lectures and concerts mostly,&mdash;for Miss
Cox thought the theatre was wicked. She was a regular
church attendant, and made me go with her Sundays.
She was thrifty, too, and taught me to be stingy with my
quarters and halves.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Enterprise Market.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The first day I could take off I went to the police
station and paid my loan from the judge. I had to wait
an hour before I could speak to him, while he ground out
a string of drunks and assaults, shooting out his sentences
like a rapid-fire battery. When I finally got his attention,
he turned one eye on me:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Edward, so you haven't gone home yet!" And
that was all he said as he dropped the coin into his
pocket. (I hope that my paying back that money made
him merciful to the next young tramp that was cast up
there before him!)</p>

<p>After I had paid the judge I strolled down to the South
Side, into the new residence district, with some idea of
seeing where the young lady lived who had first had me
arrested and then wanted to reform me. When I came
to the number she had written in the memorandum-book,
there was a piece of crape on the door. It gave me a
shock. I hung around for a while, not caring to disturb
the people inside, and yet hoping to find out that it was
not the young lady who had died. Finally I came away,
having made up my mind, somehow, that it was the young
lady, and feeling sorry that she was gone. That night
I opened the memorandum-book she had given me, and
began a sort of diary in a cramped, abbreviated hand.
The first items read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>September 30.</i> Giv. this book by young la. who tho't
I stole her purse. She hopes I may take the right road.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Got job in Ent&mdash;mark., 1417 W. VanB
St. $10. Is this the right road?</p>

<p><i>October 23.</i>&mdash;Went to address young lad. gav. me.
Found crape on the door. Hope it's the old man.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From time to time since then I have taken out the
little black memorandum-book, and made other entries of
those happenings in my life that seemed to me especially
important&mdash;sometimes a mere list of figures or names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
writing them in very small. It lies here before me now,
and out of these bare notes, keywords as it were, there
rise before me many facts,&mdash;the deeds of twenty-five
years.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When I got back to the Piersons' for dinner, Miss Cox
was curious to know what I had done with my first day
off.</p>

<p>"I bet he's been to see that girl who had him arrested,"
Lou suggested mischievously. "And from the way he
looks I guess she told him she hadn't much use for a
butcher-boy."</p>

<p>Pa Pierson laughed; he was a great admirer of his
daughter's wit.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's that much of a fool, to waste his
time trapesing about after <i>her</i>," Hillary Cox snapped
back.</p>

<p>"Well, I did look up the house," I admitted, and
added, "but the folks weren't at home."</p>

<p>After supper we sat out on the steps, and Hillary
asked me what kind of a place the young woman lived
in. I told her about the crape on the door, and she
looked at me disgustedly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ask?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I didn't care to know if it was so, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I don't see as you have any particular reason to care,
one way or the other," she retorted. And she went off
for that evening somewhere with Ed. For the want of
anything better to do I borrowed a book from the law
student, who was studying in his room, and thus, by way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of an accident, began a habit of reading and talking over
books with Slocum.</p>

<p>So I was soon fitted into my hole in the city. In that
neighborhood there must have been many hundreds of
places like Ma Pierson's boarding-house. The checker-board
of prairie streets cut up the houses like marble cake&mdash;all
the same, three-story-and-mansard-roof, yellow
brick, with long lines of dirty, soft stone steps stretching
from the wooden sidewalks to the second stories. And
the group of us there in the little basement dining room,
noisy with the rattle of the street cars, and dirty with the
smoke of factory chimneys in the rear, was a good deal
like the others in the other houses&mdash;strugglers on the
outside of prosperity, trying hard to climb up somewhere
in the bread-and-butter order of life, and to hold on tight
to what we had got. No one, I suppose, ever came to
Chicago, at least in those days, without a hope in his
pocket of landing at the head of the game sometime.
Even old Ma Pierson cherished a secret dream of a rich
marriage for one or other of her girls!</p>

<p>Hillary Cox smiled on me again the next day, and we
were as good friends as ever. As I have said, the energetic
cashier of the Enterprise Market had taken me in
hand and was forming me to be a business man. She
was a smart little woman, and had lots of good principles
besides. She believed in religion on Sundays, as she
believed in business on week days. So on the Sabbath
morning we would leave Ed and Lou and Dick Pierson
yawning over the breakfast table, while Slocum and I
escorted Grace and Hillary downtown to hear some cele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>brated
preacher in one of the prominent churches.
Hillary Cox had no relish for the insignificant and humble
in religion, such as we might have found around the
corner. She wanted the best there was to be had, she
said, and she wanted to see the people who were so much
talked about in the papers.</p>

<p>Perhaps the rich and prominent citizens made more
of a point of going to church in those days than they
do now. It was a pretty inferior church society that
couldn't show up two or three of the city's solid merchants,
who came every Sunday with their women, all
dressed in their smartest and best. Hillary and Grace
seemed to know most of these people by sight. Women
are naturally curious about one another, and I suppose
the girls saw their pictures and learned their names in
the newspapers. And in this way I, too, learned to know
by sight some of the men whom later it was my fortune
to meet elsewhere.</p>

<p>There was Steele, the great dry-goods merchant, and
Purington, whose works for manufacturing farming tools
were just behind Ma Pierson's house; Lardner, a great
hardware merchant; Maybricks, a wholesale grocer;
York, a rich lumberman&mdash;most of them thin-faced,
shrewd Yankees, who had seized that tide of fate which
the poet tells us sweeps men to fortune. And there were
others, perhaps less honorably known as citizens, but
equally important financially: Vitzer, who became known
later as the famous duke of gas, and Maxim, who already
had begun to stretch out his fingers over the street-car
lines. This man had made his money buying up tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
titles, that one building cars, and another laying out
railroads, and wrecking them, too. They were the people
of the land!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i060" id="i060"></a>
<img src="images/i060.jpg" width="450" height="419" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>That's Strauss!</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>One fine winter morning, as the four of us idled on the
sidewalk opposite a prominent South Side church that
was discharging its prosperous congregation into the
street, Slocum nudged me and pointed to a group of well-dressed
people&mdash;two or three women and a short, stout,
smooth-shaven man&mdash;who were standing on the steps of
the church, surveying the scene and bowing to their
neighbors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's Strauss!"</p>

<p>It was not necessary to say more. Even in those days
the great Strauss had made his name as well known as
that of the father of our country. He it was who knew
each morning whether the rains had fallen on the plains
beneath the Andes; how many cattle on the hoof had
entered the gates of Omaha and Kansas City; how tight
the pinch of starvation set upon Russian bellies; and
whether the Sultan's subjects had bought their bread of
Liverpool. Flesh and grain, meat and bread&mdash;Strauss
held them in his hand, and he dealt them forth in the
markets of the world!</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that I looked hard at the portly, red-faced
man, standing there on the steps of his temple,
where, with his women and children, he had been worshipping
his God?</p>

<p>"My!" said Grace, "Mrs. Strauss is plain enough,
and just common-looking."</p>

<p>(I have noticed that women find it hard to reconcile
themselves to a rich man's early taste in their sex.)</p>

<p>"She don't dress very stylish, that's true," Hillary
observed thoughtfully. "But it weren't so very long
ago, I guess, that she was saving his money."</p>

<p>Strauss, surrounded by his women folk, marched up
the avenue in solemn order. We followed along slowly
on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>"He didn't make his pile at the Enterprise Market,"
Grace remarked. She spoke the idea that was in all our
minds: how did he and the others make their money?</p>

<p>"I guess they began like other folks," Hillary con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>tended,
"saving their earnings and not putting all their
money in their stomachs and on their backs."</p>

<p>This last was aimed at Grace, who was pretty smartly
dressed.</p>

<p>"Well," said Slocum, dryly, "probably by this time
Strauss has something more than his savings in the
bank."</p>

<p>Thus we followed them down the street, speculating
on the great packer's success, on the success of all the
fortunate ones in the great game of the market, wondering
what magic power these men possessed to lift themselves
out of the mass of people like ourselves. Pretty
simple of us, perhaps you think, hanging around on the
street a good winter morning and gossiping about our
rich neighbors! But natural enough, too: we had no
place to loaf in, except Ma Pierson's smelly dining room,
and nothing to do with our Sunday holiday but to walk
around the streets and stare up at the handsome new
houses and our well-dressed and prosperous neighbors.
Every keen boy who looks out on life from the city
sidewalk has a pretty vigorous idea that if he isn't as
good as the next man, at least he will make as much
money if he can only learn the secret. We read about
the rich and their doings in the newspapers; we see
them in the streets; their horses and carriages flash by
us&mdash;do you wonder that some poor clerks on a Sunday
gape at the Steeles and the Strausses from the sidewalk?</p>

<p>What was the golden road? These men had found
it&mdash;hundreds, thousands of them,&mdash;farming tools, rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>roads,
groceries, gas, dry-goods. It made no matter
what: fortunes were building on every side; the flowers
of success were blooming before our eyes. To take my
place with these mighty ones&mdash;I thought a good deal
about that these days! And I remember Grace saying
sentimentally to Slocum that Sunday:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You fellers keep thinkin' of nothin' but money and
how you're goin' to make it. Perhaps rich folks ain't
the only happy ones in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," Hillary chimed in, "there's such a thing as
being too greedy to eat."</p>

<p>"What else are we here for except to make money?"
Slocum demanded more bitterly than usual.</p>

<p>He raised his long arm in explanation and swept it
to and fro over the straggling prairie city, with its
rough, patched look. I didn't see what there was in the
city to object to: it was just a place like any other&mdash;to
work, eat, and sleep in. Later, however, when I saw the
little towns back East, the pleasant hills, the old homes
in the valleys, and the red-brick house on the elm-shaded
street in Portland, then I knew what Slocum meant.</p>

<p>Whatever was there in Chicago in 1877 to live for but
Success?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">A MAN'S BUSINESS</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Signs of trouble at the Enterprise&mdash;A possible partnership&mdash;He
travels fastest who travels alone&mdash;John Carmichael&mdash;Feeding
the peoples of the earth&mdash;I drive for Dround</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"Do you see that big, fat fellow talking with Mr.
Joyce?" the cashier whispered to me one morning as
I passed her cage. "He's Dround's manager&mdash;his name
is Carmichael. When he shows up, there is trouble coming
to some one."</p>

<p>Dround &amp; Co. was the name of the packing firm that
the Enterprise dealt with. I tied up my bundles and
made up my cash account, thinking a good deal about
the appearance of the burly manager of the packing-house.
Pretty soon Mr. Carmichael came out into the
front store very red in the face, followed by the elder
Joyce, who had been drinking, and they had some
words. The cashier winked at me.</p>

<p>The Enterprise had been doing a good business. It
was run on a new principle for those days&mdash;strictly
cash and all cut prices, a cent off here and there, a
great sale of some one thing each day, which the house
handled speculatively. The brothers Joyce kept branching
out, but there wasn't any money to speak of behind
the firm. The Drounds and a wholesale grocer had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
backed it from the start. Nevertheless, we should have
got on all right if the elder Joyce had given up drinking
and the younger one had not taken to driving fast
horses. Latterly no matter how big a business we did,
the profits went the wrong way.</p>

<p>That evening, as Hillary Cox and I walked over to the
Piersons', she said to me abruptly, "There's going to be
a new sign at the Enterprise before long!"</p>

<p>The smart little cashier must have divined the situation
as I had.</p>

<p>"Cox's Market?" I suggested jokingly.</p>

<p>"Why not Harrington &amp; Cox?" she retorted with a
nervous little laugh. We were on the steps then, and
Ed joined us, so that I did not have to answer her
invitation. But all through the meal I kept thinking
of her suggestion. It was nearly two years since she
had introduced me to the Enterprise, and I had saved
up several hundred dollars in the meantime, which I
wanted to put into some business of my own. But it
did not quite suit my card to run a retail market.
After supper the others left us in the dining room, and
when we were alone Hillary said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of the firm name? It
wouldn't be so impossible. I've got considerable money
saved up, and I guess you have some in the bank, too.
It wouldn't be the first time in this town that a clerk's
name followed a busted owner's over the door."</p>

<p>She spoke in a light kind of way, but a tone in her
voice made me look up. It struck me suddenly that this
thing might mean a partnership for life, as well as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
partnership for meat and groceries. Hillary Cox was an
attractive woman, and she would make a splendid wife
for a poor man, doing her part to save his money.
Between us, no doubt, we could make a good business
out of the old Enterprise, and more, too!</p>

<p>"That firm name sounds pretty well," I answered
slowly, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I thought it pretty good."</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned her face shyly away from my
eyes. She was a woman, and a lovable, warm-hearted
one. Perhaps she was dreaming of a home and a family&mdash;of
just that plain, ordinary happiness which our unambitious
fathers and mothers took out of life. I liked
her all the better for it; but when I tried to say something
tender, that would meet her wish, I couldn't find
a word from my heart: there was nothing but a hollow
feeling inside me. And the thought came over me, hard
and selfish, that a man like me, who was bound on a
long road, travels best alone.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I want to sell coffee and potatoes
all my life," I said at last, and my voice sounded colder
than I meant to make it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gave a little gasp, as if some one had
struck her. "You're very ambitious, Mr. Harrington,"
she said coldly. "I hope you'll get all you think you
deserve, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Well, that wouldn't be much&mdash;only I am going to
try for more than I deserve&mdash;see?" I laughed as
easily as I could.</p>

<p>We talked a little longer, and then she made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
kind of excuse&mdash;we had planned to go out that evening&mdash;and
left me, bidding me good night as if I were
a stranger. I felt small and mean, yet glad, too, to
speak the truth&mdash;that I hadn't made a false step just
there and pretended to more than I could carry through.</p>

<p>Some time later Slocum looked in at the door, and,
seeing me alone, came into the room. He had a grim
kind of smile on his face, as if he suspected what had
been happening.</p>

<p>"Where's Grace?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Just about where your Hillary is," he answered
dryly; "gone off with another fellow."</p>

<p>I laughed. We looked at each other for some time.</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"He travels fastest who travels alone," he drawled,
using the very words that had been in my mind. "But
it is a shame&mdash;Miss Cox is a nice woman."</p>

<p>"So is the other."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it can't be&mdash;or anything like it."</p>

<p>And the difference between us was that I believe he
really cared.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So the Enterprise Market crumbled rapidly to its end,
while I kept my eye open for a landing-place when I
should have to jump. One day I was sent over to
Dround's to see why our usual order of meats hadn't
been delivered. I was referred to the manager. Carmichael,
as I have said, was a burly, red-faced Irishman&mdash;and
hot-tempered. His black hair stood up all over
his head, and when he moved he seemed to wrench his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
whole big carcass with the effort. As I made my errand
known to him, he growled something at me. I gathered
that he didn't think favorably of the Enterprise and
all that belonged thereto.</p>

<p>"They can't have any more," he said. "I told your
boss so the last time I was over."</p>

<p>I hung on, not knowing exactly what to say or do.</p>

<p>"I guess they must have it this time," I ventured
after a while.</p>

<p>"'Guess they must have it'! Who are you?"</p>

<p>He thrust his big head over the top of his desk and
looked at me, laying his cigar down deliberately, as if he
meant to throw me out of the office for my impudence.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said as easily as I could, "I'm one of their
help."</p>

<p>"Well, my son, maybe you know better than I what
they do with their money? They don't pay us."</p>

<p>I knew he was trying to pump me about the Enterprise.
I smiled and told him nothing, but I got that
order delivered. Once or twice more, having been
successful with the manager, I was sent on the same
errand. Carmichael swore at me, bullied me, and jollied
me, as his mood happened to be. Finally he said in
earnest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Joyce's got to the end of his rope, kid. You needn't
come in here again. The firm will collect in the usual
way."</p>

<p>I had seen all along that this was bound to come, and
had made up my mind what I should do in the event.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>"Do you hear?" the Irishman
roared.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Do you hear?" the Irishman roared. "What are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
you standing there for? Get along and tell your boss
I'll put a sheriff over there."</p>

<p>"I guess I have come to stay," I replied easily.</p>

<p>"Come to stay?" he said with a grin. "How much,
kid?"</p>


<p>"All you
will give me."</p>

<p>"What are
you getting?"</p>

<p>"Twenty."</p>

<p>"I'll give
you fifteen
to drive a
wagon," he
said offhand,
"and I'll fire
you in a week
if you haven't anything better
with you than your cheek."</p>

<p>"All right," I said coolly,
not letting him see that I was
ruffled by his rough tongue.</p>

<p>In that way I made the
second round of the ladder,
and went whistling out of
Dround's packing-house into
the murky daylight of the
Stock Yards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i070" id="i070"></a>

<p class="caption"><i>My part was to drive a wagon for Dround at fifteen a week.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I liked it all. Something told me that here was my
field&mdash;this square plot of prairie, where is carried on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
largest commissariat business of the world. In spite of
its filth and its ugly look, it fired my blood to be a part
of it. There's something pretty close to the earth in all
of us, if we have the stomach to do the world's work:
men of bone and sinew and rich blood, the strong men
who do the deeds at the head of the ranks, feed close to
the earth. The lowing cattle in the pens, the squealing
hogs in the cars, the smell of the fat carcasses in the heavy
wagons drawn by the sleek Percherons&mdash;it all made me
think of the soft, fertile fields from which we take the
grain&mdash;the blood and flesh that enter into our being.</p>

<p>The bigness of it all! The one sure fact before every
son and daughter of woman is the need of daily bread and
meat. To feed the people of the earth&mdash;that is a man's
business. My part was to drive a wagon for Dround at
fifteen a week, but I walked out of the Yards with the
swagger of a packer!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">FIRST BLOOD</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Wholesale&mdash;The little envies of life&mdash;Learning how to read&mdash;What
there might be in sausage&mdash;Schemes&mdash;A rise in life&mdash;Big
John's favoring eye&mdash;Going short of pork&mdash;Uncertainty&mdash;Five
thousand dollars in the bank</i></p></blockquote>


<p>I told them all at the supper table that evening how I
was going into wholesale with Henry I. Dround &amp; Co.
Slocum nodded approvingly, but before any one could say
a word of congratulation, Hillary Cox snapped this at
me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you were looking out for yourself with that Carmichael
man! I thought the Enterprise wasn't big
enough for your talents. A desk in the inside office, I
s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Not quite yet," I laughed; but I didn't say how little
my job was to be.</p>

<p>Miss Cox had given me up. I don't believe she meant
to be disagreeable, but somehow we had become strangers,
all at once. There were no more gossips on the front
steps or Sunday parties. Ed went to church with her in
my place. They were getting very close, those two, and
it didn't take a shrewd eye to see what was going to
happen sometime soon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The others were more generous than the little cashier
and inclined to make too much of my good fortune. For
the first time in my life I had the pleasure of knowing
that folks were looking up at me and envying me, and I
liked the feeling of consequence. I let them think I was
to get big wages.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll be leaving this ranch before long?"
Lou suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't wonder if I might move over to the
Palmer House."</p>

<p>A look of consternation spread over Ma Pierson's face
at my joking words. She saw a quarter of her regular
income wiped off the slate. After the others had gone I
told her it was only a joke, and that I should stay with
her "until I got married." She cried a little, and said
things were bad with her and getting worse all the time.
Lately Lou had taken to going with such kind of men
that she had no peace at all. I tried to cheer her up, and
it was a number of years after that before I could bring
myself to leave her place, although the food got worse
and worse, and the house more messy and slack.</p>

<p>Even when, later, I began to make a good deal of
money, I did not care to change my way of life. At Ma
Pierson's were the only people I knew well in the city,
and though Grace, and Lou, and Ed, and Dick weren't
the most brilliant folks in the city, they were honest,
warm-hearted souls and good enough company. And the
law clerk, Slocum, was much more. He meant a good
deal to me. He taught me how to read&mdash;I mean how
to take in ideas as they were thought out by those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
put them in books. He lent me his own books, all
marked and pencilled with notes and references, which
showed me how a well-trained mind stows away its information,
how it compares and weighs and judges&mdash;in
short, how it thinks.</p>

<p>We had many a good talk, sitting on the dusty stone
steps in our shirt sleeves late summer nights, when it was
too hot to sleep. He had read a deal of history and politics
and economics as well as his law, and when it came
to argument, he could shut me up with a mouthful of
facts that showed me how small my lookout on the world
was. I remember how he put me through his old Mill,
making me chew hard at every point until I had mastered
the theory; then he fed me Darwin and Spencer,
and Stubbs and Lecky, and a lot more hard nuts. And
I think that I owe no one in the world quite so much
as I do that keen, silent Yankee, who taught me how to
read books and know what is in them.</p>

<p>Meantime I was not doing anything wonderful over
at the Yards. For several months the big manager
scarce looked my way when he came across me, while
I drove and made deliveries to the city trade. Dround
&amp; Co.'s customers were mostly on the West Side, in the
poorer wards along the river, where Jews and foreigners
live. I used to wonder why the firm didn't try for a
better trade; but later, when I learned something about
the private agreements among the packers, I saw why
each kept to his own field. I soon came to know our
territory pretty well, and got acquainted with the little
markets. My experience at the Enterprise gave me an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
idea that I thought to turn to some account with
Dround's manager. One day, as I was driving into
the Yards, I met the Irishman, and he threw me a
greeting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello, kid! What's the good word?" And he
climbed affably into the seat beside me to drive up to
the office.</p>

<p>Here was my chance, and I took it.</p>

<p>"Why don't Dround's handle sausage?" I said to the
manager.</p>

<p>"What do you know about sausage?" he asked.</p>

<p>I told him what I had in mind. When I worked for
the Enterprise we used to have trouble in selling our
sausage. Women were afraid of it, thinking it was
made from any foul scraps in the store. So, to make
the customers take it, I hit on the plan when we had
fresh sausage meat of putting some of the sausages by
in clean little pasteboard boxes, and the next time a
particular customer came in I would call her attention
to one of the boxes, "which I had put aside for her
specially." And she would take it every time. In this
way the Enterprise built up a considerable trade in
sausages. The same condition existed in other markets,
as I knew; good customers were afraid to eat the ordinary
sausage. So, I thought, why shouldn't the packing-house
put up a superior kind of sausage in nice little
boxes, with a fancy name? The marketmen could retail
them handily. Carmichael seemed to be impressed with
my idea: he asked questions and said he would think it
over. That encouraged me to spring another scheme on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
him. Dround's trade was in the Jewish quarters, but
of course we didn't sell to the real Jews.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i076" id="i076"></a>
<img src="images/i076.jpg" width="400" height="508" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>"What do you know about sausage?" he asked.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Why not get some old rabbi and make kosher meat&mdash;the
real article? Strauss and the other packers don't
handle it. We might have the market to ourselves, and
it is a big one, too."</p>

<p>"Kid, you've got a head on you," big John said to me
with warmth. And I saw myself a member of the firm
next week!</p>

<p>It didn't work as easily as that, however. The next
time I saw the manager I asked him about sausage and
kosher meat, and he scowled. It seems he had presented
my ideas to Mr. Henry I. Dround, and that gentleman
had turned them down. He was a packer, so the head
of the house said, and no cat's-meat man, to retail sausages
in paper packages to the public. The same way
with the kosher meat idea: his business was the packing
business, and the firm wasn't trying any ventures. It
seemed to me that Mr. Henry I. Dround lacked enterprise;
I felt that his manager would have given my ideas
a trial.</p>

<p>It was not long after that, however, before Carmichael
took me into the office and made me a kind of helper
to him, sending me up and down the city to collect
accounts, look after the little markets that traded with
Dround's, and try on the sly to steal some other fellow's
business&mdash;that is, to break secretly one of those trade
agreements which the packers were always making
together, and always breaking here and there, and, when
caught, promising each other to be good, and never do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
it again&mdash;until the next opportunity offered, of course!
This was more or less confidential and delicate business,
and I was not let into the inside all at once. But I said
nothing, and kept my eyes open. I began to know some
things about the business, and I could guess a few more.
I learned pretty soon that Henry I. Dround &amp; Co. was
not one of the strongest concerns in the city; that it
was being squeezed in the ribs by the great Strauss over
the way&mdash;that, if it had not been for the smart Irishman,
Strauss might take the bread out of our mouths.</p>

<p>Next to Slocum, I owe big John Carmichael more than
I could ever pay in money. He was an ignorant, hot-tempered,
foul-mouthed Irishman, who had almost been
born in the Yards, and had seen little else than the
inside of a packing-house all his life. He couldn't write
a grammatical letter or speak an unblasphemous sentence.
But it didn't take me long to see that Dround
&amp; Co. was Carmichael, the manager, and that I was in
the best kind of luck to be there under him, and, so to
speak, part way in his confidence....</p>

<p>Well, as I said, I got an inkling from time to time how
there was a private agreement between the large firms to
carve up the market, retail as well as wholesale, and
that when one of the firms felt that they could do it
safely they would sneak around the agreement (which,
of course, was illegal) and try to steal their neighbors'
trade. Carmichael managed this business himself, and
now and then, when he saw I knew how to keep my
mouth shut, he would trust some detail of it to me.</p>

<p>But I was getting only twenty dollars a week, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
rosy prospects. My little schemes of making sausages
on a large scale and kosher meat had been turned down.
I stowed them away in my mind for future use. Meantime,
after working at the Yards for nearly two years,
I had managed to lay by about a thousand dollars, what
with my savings when I was at the Enterprise. That
thousand dollars was in a savings-bank downtown, and it
made me restless to think that it was drawing only three
and a half per cent, when chances to make big money were
going by me all the time just out of my grasp. I kept
turning over and over in my mind how I might use that
thousand and make it breed money. There were lively
times then on the Board of Trade. Nothing much was
done in the stock market in Chicago in those early days,
but when a man wanted to take his flyer he went into
pork or grain. I used to hear more or less about what
was being done on the Board of Trade from Dick Pierson,
who had been promoted from scrubbing blackboards
to a little clerkship in the same office, which operated
on the Board.</p>

<p>Dick had grown to be a sallow-faced, black-mustached
youth who had his sisters' knack of smart dressing, and
a good deal of mouth. He was always talking of the
deals the big fellows were carrying, and how this man
made fifty thousand dollars going short on lard and that
man had his all taken away from him in the wheat pit.
He was full of tips that he picked up in his office&mdash;always
fingering the dice, so to speak, but without the
cash to make a throw. Dick knew that I had some
money in the bank, and he was ever at me to put it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
on some deal on margin. Slocum used to chaff him
about his tips, and I didn't take his talk very seriously.
It was along in the early summer of my third year at
Dround's when Dick began to talk about the big deal
Strauss was running in pork. Pork was going to twenty
dollars a barrel, sure. According to Dick, all any one
had to do to make a fortune was to get on the train now.
This time his talk made some impression on me; for the
boys were saying the same thing over in the office at the
Yards. I thought of asking Carmichael about it, but
I suspected John might lie to me and laugh to see the
"kid" robbed. So I said nothing, but every time I
had occasion to go by the bank where I kept my money
it seemed to call out to me to do something. And I was
hot to do something! I had about made up my mind
after turning it over for several weeks, to make my
venture in Strauss's corner. Pork was then selling about
seventeen dollars a barrel, and there was talk of its
going as high as twenty-five dollars by the October
delivery.</p>

<p>It happened that the very day I made up my mind to
go down to the city and draw out my money I was in
the manager's office talking to him about one of our
small customers. Carmichael was opening his mail and
listening to me. He would rip up an envelope and
throw it down on his desk, then let the letter slide out
of his fat hand, and pick up another. I saw him grab
one letter in a hurry. On the envelope, which was plain,
was printed JOHN CARMICHAEL in large letters.
As he tore open the enclosure I could see that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
broker's form, and printed in fat capitals beneath the
firm name was the word SOLD, and after it a written
item that looked like pork. As Carmichael shoved this
slip of paper back in the envelope I took another look
and was sure it was pork. I went out of the office thinking
to myself: "Carmichael isn't buying any pork this
trip: he's selling. What does that mean?"</p>

<p>As I have said, the manager had charge of those
private agreements with which the trade was kept
together. In this way he came in contact with all our
rivals, and among them the great Strauss. After thinking
for a time, it was clear to me that the Irishman had
some safe inside information about this deal which Dick
did not have, nor any one else on the street. That afternoon
when I could get off I went down to the bank and
drew my money. At first I thought I would take five
hundred dollars and have something left in the bank in
case I was wrong on my guess. But the nearer I got to
the bank the keener I was to make all I could. I took
the thousand and hurried over to the office on La Salle
Street, where Dick worked. I beckoned him out of the
crowd in front of the board and shoved my bunch of
money into his hand.</p>

<p>"I want you to sell a thousand barrels of pork for
me," I said.</p>

<p>"Gee!" Dick whistled, "you've got nerve. What
makes you want to go short of pork?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," I said; "go on and tell your boss
to sell, and there's your margin."</p>

<p>"I'll have to speak to the old man himself about this,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Dick replied soberly. "This ain't any market to fool
with."</p>

<p>"Well, if he don't want the business there are others,"
I observed coolly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 40%;"><a name="i082" id="i082"></a>
<img src="images/i082.jpg" width="225" height="376" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>"All right," he called out, "we'll take
his deal."</i></p>
</div>

<p>Dick disappeared into the back office, and I had to
wait some time. Presently a fat little smooth-shaven
man shoved his head
through the door and
looked me over for a
moment with a grin
on his face. I suppose
he thought me
crazy, but he didn't
object to taking my
money all the same.</p>

<p>"All right," he
called out with another
grin, "we'll
take his deal." And
Dick came out from
the door and told me
in a big voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"All right, old
man! We sell a
thousand for you."</p>

<p>When I got out into
the street I wasn't as
sure of what I had
done as I had been when I went into the broker's
office; but I had too much nerve to admit that I wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
I had my money back in my fist. And I kept my courage
the next week, while pork hung just about where it was
or maybe went up a few cents. Then it began to slide back
just a little&mdash;$16.87&frac12;, $16.85, $16.80, were the quotations&mdash;and
so on until it reached $16.50, where it hung
for a week. Then it took up its retreat again until it had
slid to an even $16. Dick, who congratulated me on my
luck, advised me to sell and be content with doubling my
money. Strauss was just playing with the street, he
said. This was only the end of August: by the middle
of September there would be a procession. But my head
was set. To be sure, when, after the first of September,
pork began to climb, I rather wished I had been content
with doubling my money. But I pinned my faith on
Carmichael. I didn't believe he was selling yet. For a
fortnight at the close of September, pork hung about
$16.37&frac12;, with little variation either way. Then the last
three days of the month, as the time for October deliveries
drew near, it began to sag and dropped to $16.10.
I hung on.</p>

<p>It was well for me that I did. October first Strauss
began delivering, and he poured pork into the market by
the thousand barrels. Pork dropped, shot down, and
touched $13. One morning I called at the broker's office
and gave the order to buy. I had cleared four thousand
dollars in my deal.</p>

<p>It was first blood!</p>

<p>There was about five thousand dollars in the bank that
day when I went back to the Yards, and I was as proud
as a millionnaire. Somehow, I seemed to forget how I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
had learned the right tip, and thought of myself as a
terribly smart young man. Perhaps I looked what I
was thinking, for when the manager stepped out of his
office a little later and eyed me there was a queer kind of
smile on his lips.</p>

<p>"What's happened, kid?" he asked, quizzing me.
"Been selling any more pork this morning?"</p>

<p>Then I suspected that somehow he had learned about
my little venture in the market. I was doubtful just
how he might take it.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "It's the time to buy now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Covering?" he chuckled. "Well, that's good. Say,
some one telephoned out from Cooper's office for you this
morning&mdash;about a little deal in pork. I answered the
'phone."</p>

<p>So that was the way he had learned! That fool Dick
had got nervous, and been telephoning to me.</p>

<p>"I hope you made it all right," Carmichael added.</p>

<p>"You bet," I answered cheerily. And that was all
that was ever said about the matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE BOMB</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>I become a packer on my own account&mdash;What there is in sausage&mdash;The
Duchess&mdash;The Piersons' again&mdash;At the Haymarket&mdash;The
path of the bomb&mdash;Another kind of evil</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Not long after my little deal in pork Carmichael promoted
me. Instead of running around the city to look
after the markets, I was sent out on the road to the
towns that were building up all along the railroad lines
throughout the neighboring states. My business was to
secure as many of these new markets as I could, and,
wherever it was possible, to dispossess any rival that had
got hold before. It gave me a splendid chance to know
a great section of our country which was teeming with
life.</p>

<p>That five thousand dollars in the bank burned worse
than the first thousand. I took no more chances on pork,
however, but I managed to turn a dollar here and there,
and after a time something rather big came my way.
There were a couple of German Jews, the brothers
Schunemann, who were trying to run a packing business
at Aurora. They had started as small butchers, and had
done well; but they wanted to get into the packing
business, and they were having a hard time to compete
with the big fellows in Chicago. Their little plant was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
covered with a mortgage, and Dround and Strauss had
taken away most of their trade. The Schunemann
brothers were such small fish that they could make no
agreements with the large companies, and they weren't
important enough to be bought out.</p>

<p>That was what I told one of the brothers when he
asked me to say a good word for him with Carmichael.
His concern was pretty near bankruptcy then, and it was
plainly out of the question for them to go on as they had
been without capital. If they had tried to build up a
small business in <i>delicatessen</i> and such things, they might
have succeeded better. I had never given up the idea of
the money that might be made in putting up sausages
and preparing kosher meat for the city market. Here,
I thought, was just the opportunity. If I could buy out
the Schunemann brothers or get a controlling interest,
I might try my experiment. The scheme grew in my
mind, and I went to Aurora several times to see the
brothers. After a while I made the man an offer, and
then we talked terms for several months. Slocum advised
me and drew up the agreement. I was ready to put my
stake into the venture, all that I had in the world. It
hurt them to sell me the control of their business for
seven thousand dollars, which was all that I could scrape
together&mdash;and part of that was Slocum's savings, which
he lent me.</p>

<p>At last we made the arrangement, and the Schunemann
brothers put up the "Duchess" brand of sausage after
my plan, and we began to handle kosher meat in a small
way. I managed the sausage trade with Dround's busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>ness,
working the two together very well; for the retailers
who dealt with Dround's took to my idea and
pushed our Duchess brand, which was packed in nice
little boxes. It was a new idea in those days, and nothing
takes like something that hasn't been tried before.
We began to make money&mdash;not a fortune all at once;
but the business promised to grow. Thus I became a
packer, after a fashion!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the years that immediately preceded the troublous
times of 1886, I was a very busy man and often out of
the city, too much engrossed with the growing business
on my hands to consider very seriously the disturbances
of that period. The fight with labor, which seems to be
a necessary feature of our progress, had come a kind
of crisis in that year. But the events in Chicago during
that crisis are still so near to many of us that even with
the rapid forgetfulness of our days they have not quite
escaped the memory of thoughtful men.</p>

<p>I remember that now and then, around Ma Pierson's
table, the talk turned on the strike over at the harvesting
works. We were all on the same side, I guess&mdash;the
side of capital; there was enough for all of the good things
of life, we thought, if men would only stop their kicking
and keep at work. Slocum, for all that he was a lawyer,
was the only easy one on the strikers: so long as they
respected the laws he was with them in their struggle to
get all they could from their employers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Renshaw says they're too well off now," Lou
observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Renshaw?" I asked, surprised that Lou
should take an interest in such matters.</p>

<p>Slocum looked across the table at me, and Grace
quickly began on something else....</p>

<p>Well, on the night of the fourth of May I was on my
way to the Piersons' from the Union Station. It was
very late, for I had just returned from Aurora, where I
had been during the afternoon on my own business. As
I got on the street car the men on the platform were
talking excitedly about the shooting over at the harvester
works. When I reached home, I was surprised to find
no one on the steps, the door wide open, and a kind of
emptiness in the whole place.</p>

<p>"What's up?" I asked old Pierson.</p>

<p>"That Cox girl's got her cheek blowed open with a
bomb or suthin'. Times like this folks can't go gallivantin'
about the streets," the old man snarled.</p>

<p>Slocum came in at the sound of my voice and told me
what had happened. His face was white, and his long
arms still twitched with the horror of what he had seen
that night. It seems that Dick Pierson had come home
to supper full of the news about the row between the police
and the strikers. His talk had worked up the girls,&mdash;that
is, Hillary Cox and Grace,&mdash;for Lou hadn't come
home,&mdash;until all of them had started off after supper in
the direction of the harvester works, where the trouble
was reported to be.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i089" id="i089"></a>
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="390" height="554" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>His long arms twitched with horror.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Then they had strolled down to the Haymarket, where,
instead of the great crowd they had expected to find,
there were only some hundreds of men and women listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ing
quietly to several workingmen who were speechifying
from a cart. It didn't look very lively, and as a thunder
storm was coming up in the north Sloco was for going
home. But Ed, who, like a country galoot, was curious
to hear what the orator in the cart had to say, pressed
up close to the truck, in the front of the crowd, with
Hillary Cox on his arm. Suddenly, so Slocum said,
there was a shout from somewhere behind them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The police! Look out for the police!"</p>

<p>In the rush that followed, Slocum and Grace were
jammed back by the press and separated from the others.
He remembered only a little of what happened those next
moments. And what he did remember didn't tally with
the stories that were told later at the trial. In the darkness
of the lowering storm, above the heads of the close-packed,
swaying mass in the square, there sounded a dull
whir. Then came a terrific explosion. The next thing
Slocum knew he was crawling on his hands and knees,
groping in the darkness for Grace, while all around them
crackled the pistol shots of the police. Then he heard
Ed's voice shrieking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The bloody brutes have shot her!"...</p>

<p>"And Hillary?" I asked. "Is it bad?"</p>

<p>"A piece of iron ploughed across her cheek."</p>

<p>"Scar?"</p>

<p>Slocum nodded. (The truth is that if it hadn't been
for the ignorant doctor who got hold of the girl first
her looks might have been saved. But he took eleven
stitches, and there was left a long, ugly, furrowed scar
across her pretty face!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>We went up to Slocum's room, and sat there far into
the night, discussing what had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you law pills will mouse around in it
considerable," I said. "The way to do is to string 'em up
to the nearest lamp-post, as they do out West."</p>

<p>As I was saying that, a cab drove up hurriedly in the
quiet street and stopped at our door. Slocum and I put
our heads out of his window, curious to know what was
happening now at two o'clock in the morning. We saw
a man get out, then turn and lift a woman from the cab
to the street. The woman staggered as she started to
walk across the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"It's Lou Pierson!" Slocum exclaimed. He drew in
his head suddenly and bolted from the room. I waited
long enough to see the man who was with Lou pull the
doorbell, and then leave the poor girl half-fallen on the
steps, while he went back to the cab and spoke to the
driver. Then I followed Slocum downstairs, two steps
at a time. Slocum had wrenched open the house door
and leaped down the long flight of steps, not pausing at
the girl, who was making feeble attempts to rise and
calling: "Fred! Fred!" But the man, having given
his directions to the driver, paid no attention and got
into the cab.</p>

<p>I helped Lou to her feet; she was still calling in a
drowsy voice: "Fred! Fred!" I could see Slocum with
his hand on the door of the cab. He spoke to the man
inside, but I could not hear what he said. Suddenly his
hand shot out; there was a tussle, half in and half
out of the cab; the driver whipped up his horses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Slocum was thrown to his knees. He picked himself
up holding in his fist something that looked like a
necktie.</p>

<p>As Slocum helped me carry the girl up the steps, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's who Renshaw is. A bit of a bomb would be
about the right thing for him!"</p>

<p>Generalizations, I have learned, are silly things to play
with. But there are some experiences in a man's life
that tempt him to make them. It was only a mere accident
that the man who was Lou Pierson's companion in
the cab that night had taken a prominent part against
the striking workmen. But when, later, I was called
upon to sit in judgment on some hot-headed fools because
they, in their struggle to get an eight-hour day, fomented
strife, my thoughts would go back sourly to this example
of the men I was expected to side with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE TRIAL OF THE ANARCHISTS</p>

<p>The morning after the fourth of May the city was
sizzling with excitement. From what the papers said
you might think there was an anarchist or two skulking
in every alley in Chicago with a basket of bombs under
his arm. The men on the street seemed to rub their
eyes and stare up at the buildings in surprise to find
them standing. There was every kind of rumor flying
about: some had it that the police had unearthed a general
conspiracy to dynamite the city; others that the
bomb throwers had been found and were locked up. It
was all a parcel of lies, of course, but the people were
crazy to be lied to, and the police, having nothing better,
fed them lies. At the Yards, men were standing
about in little groups discussing the rumors; they seemed
really afraid to go into the buildings.</p>

<p>In front of our office a brougham was drawn up&mdash;an
unusual sight at any time, and especially at this hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
It was standing close to the door, and as I picked my
way through the crowd I looked in at the open window.
My eyes met the eyes of a woman, who was leaning
against the cushioned back of the carriage. She was
dressed in a white, ruffled gown that appeared strange
there in the yards, and her eyes were half closed, as if
she were napping or thinking thoughts far removed from
the agitated city. But when I came closer she gave me
the sharpest look I ever saw in a woman's eyes. It was
a queer face, dark and pale and lifeless&mdash;except for that
power of the eyes to look into you. I stopped, and my
lips opened involuntarily to speak. As I went on upstairs,
I wondered who she could be.</p>

<p>My desk was just outside the manager's private office,
and, the door happening to be ajar, I could see Mr.
Dround within, striding up and down in great excitement.
Carmichael was trying to quiet him down. I
could hear the chief's high, thin voice denouncing the
anarchists:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a dastardly crime against God and man! It
threatens the very foundations of our free country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all right," big John was growling in his
heavy tone. "But we don't want to make too much fuss;
it won't do no good to poke around in a nest of rattlers."</p>

<p>"Let them do their worst! Let them blow up this
building! Let them dynamite my house! I should call
myself a craven, a poltroon, if I wavered for one moment
in my duty as a citizen."</p>

<p>Carmichael sighed and bit off the end of a fat cigar
that he had been rolling to and fro in his mouth. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
seemed to give his boss up, as you might a talkative
schoolboy.</p>

<p>Henry Iverson Dround was a tall, dignified gentleman,
with thick gray hair, close-cut gray whiskers, and a grizzled
mustache. He always dressed much better than
most business men of my acquaintance, with a sober
good taste. The chief thing about him was his manners,
which, for a packer, were polished. I knew that he had
been to college: there was a tradition in the office that
he had gone into the business against his will to please
his father, who had begun life as a butcher in the good
old way and couldn't understand his son's prejudices.
Perhaps that explains why all the men in the house
thought him haughty, and the other big packers were
inclined to make fun of him. However that might be,
Mr. Dround had a high reputation in the city at large for
honorable dealing and public spirit. There was little
set afoot for the public good that Henry I. Dround did
not have a hand in.</p>

<p>I had met the chief once or twice, big John having
called his attention to me, but he never seemed to remember
my existence. To-day Mr. Dround blew out of
the manager's office pretty soon and brushed against my
desk. Suddenly he stopped and addressed me in his
thin, high voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mr. Harrington, of this infernal
business?"</p>

<p>My answer was ready, pat, and sufficiently hot to
please the boss. He turned to Carmichael, who had
followed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is what young America is thinking!"</p>

<p>Carmichael put his tongue into his cheek instead of
spitting out an oath; but after Mr. Dround had gone,
he growled at me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's all right for young America, but I am no damn
fool, either! My father saw the riots back home in Dublin.
It's no good sitting too close on the top of a chimney&mdash;maybe
you'll set the house on fire. The police? The
police are half thieves and all blackguards! They got
this up for a benefit party, most likely. Why, didn't they
kill more'n twice as many men over at McCormick's only
the other day, just because the boys were making a bit
of a disturbance? And nobody said anything about it!
What are they kicking for, anyway?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround's view, however, was the one generally
held. That very evening there was a meeting of the
prominent men of the city to take counsel together how
anarchy might be suppressed with a strong hand. We
little people heard only rumors of what took place in
that gathering, but it leaked out that there had been two
minds among those wealthy and powerful men&mdash;the
timid and the bold. The timid were overridden by the
bolder-hearted. Good citizens, like Strauss and Vitzer,
so Carmichael told me with a sneer, talked strong about
encouraging the district attorney to do his duty, and
raised a fund to pay for having justice done.</p>

<p>"It means that some of those rats the police have been
ferreting out of the West Side saloons will hang to make
them feel right. The swells are bringing pressure to
bear, and some one must be punished. It's grand!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>He chuckled bitterly at his own wit. But the swells
meant business, and when Henry I. Dround was drawn
for the grand jury, to indict those anarchists that the
police had already netted, big John swore:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He needn't have done that! There are plenty to do
the fool things. It's his sense of duty, I s'pose, damn
him! It's some of his duty to come over here and help
us make enough money to keep his old business afloat!"</p>

<p>The Irishman thought only of the business, but Henry
I. Dround was not the man to let any personal interest
stand in the way of what he considered his duty to
society. Perhaps he was a little too proud of his sacrifices
and his civic virtues. Some years later he told me
all about that grand jury. All I need say here is that
this famous trial of the anarchists was engineered from
the beginning by prominent men to go straight.</p>

<p>The hatred and the rage of all kinds of men during
those months while the anarchists were on our hands,
before they were finally hanged or sent to prison, is hard
to understand now at this distance from the event. That
bomb in its murderous course had stirred our people to
the depths of terror and hate: even easy-going hustlers
like myself seemed to look at that time in the face of an
awful fate. The pity of it all was&mdash;I say it now openly
and advisedly&mdash;that our one motive was hate. Stamp
this thing out! that was the one cry. Few stopped to
think of justice, and no one of mercy. We were afraid,
and we hated.</p>

<p>Finally it came time for the trial; the <i>venire</i> for the
jury was issued. One night, to my consternation, I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a summons at the house. When I showed it to a fellow-clerk
at the office the next morning, he whistled:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought I saw the bailiff in here yesterday, looking
around for likely men. They are after a safe jury this
time, sure!"</p>

<p>I asked Carmichael to use his influence to get me
excused, as I knew he usually did for the boys when
they were summoned for jury duty. But all he said
was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're a nervy youngster. You'd better do the thing,
if you are accepted."</p>

<p>"It means weeks, maybe months, off," I objected.</p>

<p>"We'll make that all right: you won't lose nothing
by it. But you mustn't mind finding a stick of dynamite
under your bed when you go home after the trial,"
he grinned.</p>

<p>"I guess there's no trouble with my nerve," I said
stiffly, thinking he was chaffing me. "But I don't want
the job, all the same."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to see the old man this time.
Maybe he can get you off."</p>

<p>So I went into Mr. Dround's private office and made
my request. The chief asked me to take a chair and
handed me a cigar. Then he began to talk about the
privileges and duties of citizenship. From another man
it might have been just slobber, but Henry I. Dround
meant it, every word.</p>

<p>"Why don't you serve?" I asked him pretty bluntly.</p>

<p>He flushed.</p>

<p>"I haven't been drawn. Besides, it has been thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
wiser not to give the jury too capitalistic a character.
This is a young man's duty. And I understand from
Mr. Carmichael that you are one of the most energetic
and right-minded of our young
men, Mr. Harrington."</p>

<p class="caption"><i>From another man it might
have been just slobber, but
Henry I. Dround meant
it, every word.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He stood facing the window
and talked along for some time
in a general way. His talk was
rather simple and condescending,
but kind. He spoke of the
future before me, of my having
the right influence in the community.
When I left him I
knew perfectly well that the
house expected me to serve on
that jury if I was chosen, and
that Mr. Dround would take
personally the warmest interest
in a young man who had the
courage to do his duty "in
behalf of society," as he kept
saying.</p>

<p>Still I hoped to escape. I was tolerably far down
the list. So day after day I listened to the wrangle
among the lawyers over the selection of the jurors. It
was clear enough from the start that the State wanted
only one kind of man on that jury&mdash;an intelligent, well-to-do
clerk or small manufacturer. No laboring man
need apply: his class was suspect. As a clerk in Steele's
store said to me while we waited our turn:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"That bailiff came into our place and walked down
past our department with the manager. I heard him
say to Mr. Bent: 'I'm running this case. Let me tell
you there won't be no hung jury.'"</p>

<p>"Do you want to serve?" I asked the man from
Steele's.</p>

<p>"Well, I do and I don't." Then he leaned over and
whispered into my ear: "It looks to me that there might
be a better place for me at Steele's if everything goes off
to suit and I am a part of it!" He nudged me and
pulled a straight face. "I guess they ought to be
hanged, all right," he added, as if to square himself
with what he was ready to do.</p>

<p>After the defence had used up its challenges, which
naturally was pretty soon, the real business of getting
the jury began. Much the same thing happened in
every case. First the man said he was prejudiced so
that he couldn't render a fair verdict on the evidence.
Then his Honor took him in hand and argued with him
to convince him that his scruples were needless. His
Honor drove him up and down hill until the man was
forced to admit that he had some sense of fairness
and could be square and honest if he tried hard.
And then he was counted in. In every case it went
pretty much as it did in the case of the man from
Steele's.</p>

<p>"I feel," so the man from Steele's said, "like any
other good citizen does. I feel that some of these men
are guilty; we don't know which ones, of course. We
have formed this opinion by general report from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
newspapers. Now, with that feeling it would take some
very positive evidence to make me think that these men
were not guilty, if I should acquit them.... But I
should act entirely upon the testimony."</p>

<p>"But," said the defence, "you say that it would
take positive evidence of their innocence before you
could consent to return them not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should want some strong evidence."</p>

<p>"Well, if that strong evidence of their innocence was
not introduced, then you want to convict them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>Then the judge took him in hand, and after a time his
Honor got him to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe I could try the case on the evidence alone,
fairly."</p>

<p>And so they took him, and they took me in the same
way, when it came my turn.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This is scarcely the place to tell the story of that
famous trial. It has kept me too long as it is. The
trial of the anarchists was an odd accident in my life,
however, which, coming, as it did, when I had my foot
placed on the ladder of fortune, had something to do with
making me what I am to-day. Up to this time I had never
reflected much upon the deeper things of life. The
world seemed good to me&mdash;a stout, hearty place to
fight in. I had made money in the scheme of things as
they are, and I found it good. I wanted to make some
more money, and I had little patience with the kickers
who tried to upset the machine. But I had not reasoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
it out. There in the court room, and later shut up in the
jury quarters, day after day, cut off from my usual habits,
I thought over some of the real questions of our life, and
made for myself a kind of philosophy.</p>

<p>To-day, after the lapse of eighteen years, I can see it
all as I saw it then: the small, dirty court room; the
cold, precise face of the judge; the faces of the eight
men whom the police had ferreted out of their holes for
us to try. There wasn't much dignity in the performance:
some pretty, fashionably dressed girls sat up behind
the judge, almost touching elbows with his Honor.
They came there as though to the play, whispering
and eating candy. There was the wrangling among the
lawyers, snarling back and forth to show their earnestness.
But my eyes came back oftenest to the faces of
those eight men, for whose lives the game was being
played. Two were stupid; three were shifty; but the
other three had an honest glow, a kind of wild enthusiasm,
that came with their foreign blood, maybe. They
were dreamers of wild dreams, but no thugs!</p>

<p>From the start it seemed plain that the State could
not show who threw that fatal bomb, nor who made it,
nor anything about it: the best the State could do
would be to prove conspiracy. The only connection the
lawyers could establish between those eight men and the
mischief of that night was a lot of loose talk. His
Honor made the law&mdash;afterward he boasted of it&mdash;as
he went along. He showed us what sedition was, and
that was all we needed to know. Then we could administer
the lesson. Now that eighteen years have passed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that looks to me like mighty dangerous law. Then I
was quick enough to accept it.</p>

<p>When we filed into the court room the last morning to
listen to the judge's charge, the first face I saw was that
of Hillary Cox. A big red scar, branching like a
spider's web, disfigured her right cheek. It drew my eyes
right to her at once. All her color and the plump, pretty
look of health had gone for good. She looked old and
sour and excited. And I wished she hadn't come there:
it seemed as though she was waiting for her revenge for
the loss of her youth and good looks. She was counting
on me to give it to her! Ed sat beside her, holding her
hand in a protecting way. He was an honest, right-feeling
sort of fellow, and I guessed that her loss of good
looks would make no difference in his marrying her.</p>

<p>Near the district attorney sat Mr. Dround. He listened
to the judge's charge very closely, nodding his head as
his Honor made his points and rammed conviction into
us....</p>

<p>"In behalf of society"&mdash;his phrase ran in my head
all through the trial. That was the point of it all&mdash;a
struggle between sensible folks who went about their
business and tried to get all there was in it&mdash;like myself&mdash;and
some scum from Europe, who didn't like the way
things are handed out in this world. We must hang
these rebels for an example to all men. To be sure, the
police had killed a score or two of their kind&mdash;"rioters,"
they were called: now we would hang these eight in a
proper, legal, and ordinary way. And then back to business!
I suppose that the world seemed to me so good a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
place to hustle in that I couldn't rightly appreciate the
complaint of these rebels against society. And at any
rate I was convinced that we sensible folks who had the
upper hand could not tolerate any bomb foolishness.
"In behalf of society"&mdash;yes, before we had left our
seats in the court room my mind was made up: guilty or
not, these men must suffer for their foolish opinions,
which were dead against the majority.</p>

<p>Thus I performed my duty to society.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When our verdict was ready, and we came in to be discharged,
I saw Hillary Cox again. As the foreman rose
to give our verdict, her scarred face flushed with excitement,
and an ugly scowl crept over her brow. I turned
away. Queer thoughts came into my mind&mdash;for the bad
air and the weeks of close confinement had made me
nervous, I suppose.... Society! I seemed to see old
Strauss with his puffy, ashen face, and his broad
hands that hooked in the dollars, dirty or clean, and
Vitzer, who kept our honorable council on his pay-roll
for convenience, and the man who had been with Lou
Pierson that night, and many others. Were they better
men before the eyes of God these eight misguided
fools whom we were about to punish? Who did the
most harm to society, they or that pale-faced Fielden, who
might have been a saint instead of an anarchist?...</p>

<p>The judge was still making remarks; the jury were
listening restlessly; the prisoners at the bar seemed little
interested in the occasion. I kept saying to myself:
"Society! In behalf of society! I have done my duty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
behalf of society." But what was this almighty society,
anyhow, save a lot of fools and scamps with a sprinkling
of strong souls, who were fighting for life&mdash;all of them
fighting for what only a few could get? My eyes rested
on Hostetter's face in the crowd. His jaw was hanging
open, and he was staring at the judge, trying to understand
it all. Poor Ed! <i>He</i> wouldn't have much show
in the scramble if society didn't protect
him. Suddenly a meaning to it all
came to me like a great light. The
strong must rule: the world was for
the strong. It was the act of an idiot
to deny that truth. Yes, life was for
the strong, all there was in it! I saw
it so then, and I have lived it so all
my life....</p>

<p class="caption">"<i>My! I tell you

</div>

<p>The man from Steele's nudged my
elbow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My! I tell you I'll be glad to get
home to-night. Won't the old woman's food taste slick
to-night? You bet."</p>

<p>"The jury is discharged."</p>

<p>The play was over. The spectators were moving from
the crowded room. At the door my friends were waiting
for me. Hillary Cox stretched up a thin hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Van," she said.</p>

<p>"You fellows did just right," Hostetter added.</p>

<p>Slocum said nothing, but there was a dubious smile on
his lips.</p>

<p>"We're going to blow you off for a dinner at the Palmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
House, the best you ever ate," Dick Pierson called out
loudly. Then he added for the benefit of the onlookers,
"To hell with the anarchists!"</p>

<p>"Quit that!" I said sharply, some of those queer
doubts about the justice of the act I had been concerned
in returning to me. "It's over now, and let's drop it."</p>

<p>It was good to be out on the streets once more, knocking
elbows with folks, and my heart soon began to feel
right. In the lobby of the hotel men I didn't know,
who recognized me as one of the famous jury, came up
to me and shook hands and said pleasant things. Before
the dinner was far along I was quite myself again, and
when Slocum set up the champagne for the party, I had
begun to feel rather proud of the part I had taken in
public affairs. After all, it was a fine thing to live and
hustle with your neighbors for the dollars. I had done
my part to make the game go on smoothly. At the
Yards, the next morning, it was the same thing: my desk
was covered with flowers, and the boys kept me busy
shaking hands and taking in the cigars until I thought I
was at a church presentation party. Big John was one
of the first to welcome me back.</p>

<p>"Say! do you want a vacation? The old man thinks
a month or two would be the right thing. Enjoy yourself,
my boy, after your arduous duty!"</p>

<p>"Shoo!" I replied. "What would I do with a
month's vacation, John? I've just pined to be back
here at work. What do I want to light out for now?"</p>

<p>"Supposing some of 'em should try to fix <i>you</i>?" he
grinned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess we've fixed <i>them</i> for good and all."</p>

<p>"Well, your nerve is all right."</p>

<p>So I sat down to my desk, quite the cock of the walk,
and felt so pleased with myself that you would think I
had saved the whole town from being blown up. I was
for society as it is, first, last, and all the time, and I felt
good to be in it.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Big John was one of the first to welcome me back.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Once, some months later, I saw those eight men again,
when they were brought into court to be sentenced.
They all had a chance to speechify, and I listened to
them for a time. I didn't take much stock in Spies and
Parsons&mdash;long-winded, talky, wild fellows. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
others, who weren't as glib as those two, had a kind of
simple sincerity about them. They had the courage to
stand up there in the face of death and say what they
believed. No one plead for mercy. I was sorry for them.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, it was comfortable to be of the
strong. The world is for the strong, I said to myself as
I left the court, and I am one of them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">ANOTHER BOOST</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>I become of importance in Dround's&mdash;Making money&mdash;The end
of Ma Pierson's&mdash;Rivals in sausage&mdash;I conclude to sell my
business&mdash;Bluffing old Strauss&mdash;Carmichael regards me with
respect</i></p></blockquote>


<p>After the trial came another boost at Dround's.
Thanks to the big Irishman, I had done pretty well
before; but now there was some one at the top watching
me. I was given a chance to see what I could do to
make markets in the new Southwest, which was developing
rapidly and in my opinion offered a weak house like
ours a better opportunity than the older fields.</p>

<p>And my little venture with the brothers Schunemann
was booming all the time. Ed and Sloco had looked
out for my interests during the trial, and had kept my
partners from robbing me. Pretty soon I was able to
buy out their interest in the Aurora plant and get rid of
them altogether, putting Ed in as my manager. The
Schunemanns took to peddling our kosher meat in
Chicago, and worked up a good trade. In my trips for
Dround &amp; Co. I was able to make a large business for the
Duchess brand of sausage, which soon began to attract
attention. One day Carmichael said to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you're a sausage maker, after all, Van?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and coining money, too," I replied. "Perhaps
Mr. Dround would think differently now about the cat's-meat
business."</p>

<p>Carmichael grunted. I suspected that he might like to
have me offer the firm a chance to come into my business,
but I had no such idea. I saw a great future in sausage,
and, after that, other things&mdash;down a long vista of
golden years.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>About this time Lou Pierson disappeared from the
house and never came back. Slocum went East and did
his best to find the girl. He may have been too proud to
marry her sister, but he felt badly enough over Lou's going
that way. Later, when I saw the girl in New York, I
concluded her return could do no good to any one, and
said nothing. After Lou disappeared the old man began
to drink pretty hard, and finally had to go to the
hospital. The Van Buren Street house was a drearier
place than ever, and Slocum and I decided to move and
start housekeeping together. Ma Pierson needed us no
longer. The Hostetters were keeping house for the
old lady; for Ed married Hillary shortly after the trial,
and together they tried running the Enterprise. But
they could not make it go, somehow; so later I made
Ed my manager, as I have said. Some time after this,
when the old lady Pierson got sick, Slocum and I saw
that she had a little rest and comfort to the end of her
days. For her son Dick could never look after anybody
but himself.</p>

<p>We had not been long in our comfortable flat on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
South Side before an unexpected chance came to me to
make a lot of money. As I have said, the Duchess
brand of sausage, packed in dainty little boxes, was
making a name for itself and attracting the attention
of the trade. I began to have rivals, and my profits
were cut somewhat; but they could never drive out the
Duchess, which had a good start. One day Carmichael
asked me if I would like to sell my sausage factory, as
he called the Aurora plant. I told him jokingly he
hadn't the money to buy it. But in reality I was ready
to sell, for I saw that if the big packers went into the
business in earnest, I could not compete. And it was
only a matter of time before they would see, as I had
seen, the immense profit in such small things. So when,
a few days later, Carmichael said that one of Strauss's
men had asked him to bring me over to their place, I
went quick enough.</p>

<p>Carmichael took me into Strauss's office and introduced
me to one of the men, a shrewd little fellow, who
managed some of the old man's deals for him. After a
little while, the man, Gooch, began to talk of my sausage
business, praised the idea, and hinted that his boss
might consider buying me out "for a proper figure."
So we began to deal, and pretty soon Gooch named a
figure, twenty-five thousand dollars or something of the
sort, expecting me to bite. I laughed, and Carmichael,
who was sitting by enjoying the fun, said: "He's no kid,
Gooch, though he looks it. Better go your whole figure
straight off." Gooch then said thirty-five thousand dollars&mdash;that
was the limit. I began to talk about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
kosher meat business the Schunemann brothers were
handling for me, and I could see Gooch's eyes open.
He got up and went back into an inner office, and when
he returned he made the figure fifty thousand dollars.
Carmichael expected me to take his offer, and if I had
been asked that morning I should have said it was a
big price. But suddenly it came into my mind that in
that inner office was the great Strauss himself. He
thought I was too small fry to deal with: he left me to
his lieutenant. And I had a good mind to bring him out
to buy my plant of me. So I talked on, and Gooch asked
me to name my figure.</p>

<p>"Seventy thousand," I answered pretty quick.</p>

<p>Gooch turned to his desk, as if to tell me to go home,
and Carmichael grunted, thinking how he would laugh
at me about my cheek. I began to think I had gone
too far, when the door of that inner office was pulled
back and Strauss himself walked into the room. He
nodded to Carmichael and gave me a look from head to
foot, but said nothing. Gooch waited for the great man
to speak.</p>

<p>"We'll take your figure, Mr. Harrington," Strauss
said, after he had looked me up and down, and walked
out again.</p>

<p>It took my breath away: the next moment I was
sorry I hadn't said a hundred, it seemed so easy. But
Strauss was back in his office and the door was pulled to.</p>

<p>The next I knew I was on the street, and big John
was laughing so that men turned to look at him.
"Pretty good for a kid," he kept saying between his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
bursts of laughter. "You had the old fox on the run.
He wanted your cat's-meat place bad, though."</p>

<p>We went into a saloon, and I set up a bottle of

<p>"You're all right," Carmichael said to me when we
had drunk to my good luck. "You couldn't have run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
that place much longer. The big ones would have eaten

<p>It was a hot day in August three years after the trial;
I was sitting in Carmichael's office trying to get a breath
of fresh air from his west windows. I called old Peters
and asked him to send me up a stenographer.</p>

<p>"Haven't a good one in the place, Mr. Harrington," he
said. "All the smart ones are off on their vacation.
There's Miss Gentles, though&mdash;the old man generally
keeps her for himself, but he's gone home by this
time."</p>

<p>"Send up anything so long as it can write!"</p>

<p>"Well, she <i>ain't</i> much good," Peters replied.</p>

<p>I had my head down behind my desk when the stenographer
came in, and I began to dictate without looking
up. These stenographer ladies were all of a piece to
me,&mdash;pert, knowing misses,&mdash;all but Miss Harben: she
was fifty and sour, and took my letters like biting off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
thread. This one evidently wasn't in her class, for pretty
soon she sang out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please wait! I can't go so fast."</p>

<p>So I waited, and looked up to see what I had to do with.
This young woman was a good-looking, ladylike person,
with a mass of lovely brown hair and long brown eyelashes.
She was different from the other girls in the
office, and yet it seemed to me I had seen her before.
She was dressed in black, a sort of half mourning, I
judged. Pretty soon she got stuck again and asked me
to repeat. This time she looked at me imploringly.</p>

<p>"I am not very good," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, you are not," I replied.</p>

<p>She laughed at my blunt answer&mdash;laughed pleasantly,
like a lady who knows how to turn off a harsh truth, not
flirtatiously, like most of her profession.</p>

<p>"Been long at it?" I asked the next time she broke
down.</p>

<p>"Not so very. I graduated from the school about six
months ago, and I have always worked for Mr. Dround
since then. He doesn't talk as fast as you do, not
nearly."</p>

<p>She smiled again at me, frankly and naturally. Suddenly
I remembered where I had seen that face before,
and when she looked up again I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you ever find that purse, Miss Gentles?"</p>

<p>She looked puzzled at first; then a light spread over
her face, and she stammered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, of course, you are <i>the</i> Mr. Harrington who&mdash;But
you have changed!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather, I hope! And the light wasn't good in the
police station that morning."</p>

<p>Miss Gentles leaned back in her chair and laughed, a
blush spreading prettily over her face.</p>

<p>"It's all so funny!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Funnier now than it was then," I admitted.</p>

</div>

<p>"I am very glad to meet you again. No, I never found
that purse. The judge still twits me, when he sees me,
about changing my mind. He thinks&mdash;" Then she
stopped in embarrassment, and it was some time before I
found out what the judge did think.</p>

<p>"Have you been back to that place in Indiana?" she
asked. And we had quite a chat. She talked to me like
a young lady who was receiving a caller in her father's
house. It took a long time to finish the few letters I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
started to write. When she went, I got up and opened
the door for her. I had to.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Harrington," she said, holding
out her hand. "I am so glad to have met you again."</p>

<p>Old Peters, who was in the outer office, looked at us in
considerable surprise. When Miss Gentles had gone he
remarked in a gossiping way:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you know the young woman?"</p>

<p>"I met her once years ago," I admitted. "How did
she land here? She doesn't seem to have had much
experience as a stenographer."</p>

<p>"No, she hasn't. Her father died several years ago,
and didn't leave a cent. He was a very popular doctor,
though&mdash;a Southerner. They lived kind of high, I
guess, while there was anything. The Drounds knew
them in their better days, and when the doctor died
Mrs. Dround tried to help the girl in one way and
another. Then they fixed up this job for her. I guess
Mr. Dround don't work her very hard. Sorry you were
troubled with her. We'll see that you get a rattler the
next time, Mr. Harrington," he ended. (The men in the
office were pretty nice to "Mr. Harrington" these days!)</p>

<p>"Oh, she isn't so bad!" I said to Peters. For I rather
looked forward to seeing the pretty, pleasant-mannered
girl again. "I'd just as soon have Miss Gentles next
week when Mr. Dround goes East, if no one else wants
her."</p>

<p>Old Peters had a twinkle in his eyes as he answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Mr. Harrington."</p>

<p>So I came to see a good deal of Miss Gentles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
summer while Mr. Dround was away on his vacation.
I can't say that the young lady developed much business
ability. She forgot most things with a wonderful ease,
and she was never very accurate. But she tried hard,
and it seemed to worry her so when I pointed out her
mistakes that I took to having in another stenographer
in the afternoon to finish what she hadn't done.</p>

<p>Miss Gentles boarded with an old aunt of her mother's
near where Slocum and I lived. I gathered that the
aunt and her husband were not very kind to her. They
thought she ought to marry, having good looks and no
money. Miss Gentles let me call on her, and before the
summer was over we were pretty well acquainted. For
a long time the thought of May had kept me from looking
at a woman; I always saw that little white face
and those searching eyes, and heard that mocking laugh.
But Miss Gentles was so different from May that she
never made me think of the woman I had once loved.</p>

<p>I took Slocum to call on my new acquaintance, but
they didn't get on well together. She thought his old
Yankee ways were hard, and I suppose he thought I was
bound on the voyage of life with a pleasure-loving mate.
He used to growl to me about tying myself to a woman,
but I always said he needn't worry about me&mdash;I wasn't
the marrying kind.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be wanting to get married the same as the
rest of the world," Sloco would answer, "and have a
wife and children to spend your money on and make you
earn more!"</p>

<p>But I thought differently. A man of my sort, I replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
to him, works and fights just the same without wife or
child, because of the fight in him, because he can't help
himself, any more than the man who wants to drink
can keep his lips from the glass. It's in his blood and
bone....</p>

<p>Miss Gentles had seen a good deal of society,&mdash;the best
there was in the city in those early days. It was odd to
hear her talking about people who were just big names
to me, as if she had known them all her life. I must
have struck her as pretty green. But she made me feel
from the first like some one she had always known. She
was proud enough, but simple, and not in the least reserved.
She told me all about her people, the easy times
and the hard times. And never a word of complaint or
regret for all the parties and good things that were gone
out of her life. She was one to take her beer with a
joke when she couldn't have champagne. Of course,
I told her, first and last, all my story. She made me
take her to see the Hostetters at the old place on Van
Buren Street. Then the four of us went up the lake on
a picnic one Sunday. Hillary, I remember, was sullen
because Ed paid so much attention to Miss Gentles on
this trip.</p>

<p>So we became good friends. Yet I never felt really
intimate with her, as I had with Hillary, and when I
tried to step past a certain line she had her own way
of keeping me off, not haughtily or pertly, but like a
lady who knew how people of the great world, where
I had never been, behaved to one another. One day, I
remember, I was fool enough to send her a little fancy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
purse with a gold eagle in it, and a line saying that it
was time for me to make restitution, or something of the
sort. My gift came back quick enough, with a clever
little note tucked inside, saying she couldn't let me
admit that I had taken her purse. It was a good lesson
for me.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dround returned in the fall she reported to
him for work, and I was not altogether sorry. I had
plenty of chances to see her outside of the office now,
and I was desperately busy. In a few days, however,
when I happened to be in Mr. Dround's office on some
matter, he began to talk about Miss Gentles. Peters had
told him that I had had her as my stenographer during
his absence, and Mr. Dround would like to have me continue,
as she wasn't adapted to his needs. Then he spoke
of her people, and how he and Mrs. Dround had held them
in the highest esteem, and had tried to do something
for this girl. But there had seemed to be nothing that
she was really fitted to do.</p>

<p>So we began again our work together, only it was
worse; for her fashionable friends were back in the
city now, and they kept inviting her out to parties and
one thing and another, until she was too sleepy to do her
work in the morning and was rather irregular. Then she
was ill, off for a fortnight. I had Peters hire me another
stenographer, a man, and Miss Gentles still drew her pay.
Peters winked at me when I suggested that he needn't
mention the fact of her absence in his report. I suppose,
if I had stopped to think of it, I should have considered
it more businesslike of her to quit her society and parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
when she found they were interfering with her work.
It was human, though, that she should want to get a
little fun out of her life, and not lose sight altogether
of the gay world where they have time to amuse themselves.
And a pretty woman like her could hardly be
expected to take stenography in a stock-yards office
seriously.</p>

<p>Well, I missed her more and more, especially as I
couldn't see her now that she was ill, and had to content
myself with nice little notes of thanks for the
flowers and fruit I sent. She came back at last, looking
weak and droopy, for the first time rather hopeless,
as if she saw that she wasn't fitted for the job and
couldn't keep up with her friends, either. I felt very
sorry for her. She wasn't made for work&mdash;any one
could see that&mdash;and it was a cruel shame to let her
boggle on with it. Just then I had to go to Texas on
business; when I got back a week or so later, Peters
told me that Miss Gentles had left five days before.
A cold little note on my desk said good-by, and thanked
me for my kindness to her&mdash;never a word of explanation.</p>

<p>I was so upset that I didn't wait to open my letters,
but called a cab and started for the aunt's to find out
what was the matter. It was just as well I had been in a
hurry, for in another ten minutes Miss Gentles would have
been on her way to Louisville, and it would have taken
a week to hunt out the small place in Kentucky where
she was going. Her trunk was packed, and she was
sitting with her aunt in the large, ugly parlor, waiting
for the expressman to come. When I walked in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
following the servant, she didn't draw back her veil,
but merely stood up and touched fingers with me.
I saw that something was so wrong that it had to be
made right at once, with no time to spare.</p>

<p>"You will kindly let me speak to Miss Gentles alone,"
I said to the aunt, who was inclined to stick. She went
out of the room ungraciously.</p>

<p>"Now," I said, taking the girl's hand and looking
through her veil into her eyes, "what is the matter?
Tell me."</p>

<p>Her eyes were large and moist, and her lips quivered.
But she shut her teeth down hard and said stiffly:
"Nothing whatever, Mr. Harrington. You are very
kind to come to see me before I leave."</p>

<p>"You aren't going to put me off with any such smooth
answer as that," I said, "or you will have my company
all the way you're going, wherever it may be. Tell me
the straight truth, and all of it."</p>

<p>She began to laugh at my bluffing words, and ended
with a nervous sob. After a while I learned the whole
story. It seems that the man I employed talked out
in the office about how he did all my work, and while
I was South one of the "lady" stenographers had said
something to Miss Gentles&mdash;a something she would not
tell me. So she got up and took her leave, and knowing
that her old aunt wouldn't want her around if she had
no job, she had written some cousins in Kentucky and
was going to them.</p>

<p>The expressman came about this time, but he didn't
take her trunk. And when I left that chilly parlor we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
were engaged to be married. She said at the last, putting
her hands on my coat: "You know I always liked you,
even in the police station, Mr. Harrington&mdash;and&mdash;and
I am so very, very happy, now, Van! It was terrible to
think of going away. I had to, before you were due
home. I was never so miserable before in my life!"</p>

<p>Something stirred from the bottom of my heart. I
felt pitiful for all her trouble, her weakness, her struggle
with a world she wasn't made for. Then she said trustingly,
like a little child:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you will always be good to me, as papa was with
mamma, and patient, and love me a great deal, won't
you? Yes, I know you will!"</p>

<p>I kissed her, feeling then that nothing in life could
ever be like the privilege of loving and protecting this
woman in her helplessness. I suppose that words like
those she and I spoke then are common enough between
men and women when they are in love. Yet those words
have always been to me like some kind of sacred oath&mdash;the
woman asking, out of her weakness, for love and
protection from the one who holds all happiness and life
for her, and the man, with his hasty passions, promising
of the best there is in him.</p>

<p>Many a time in later years, when it hasn't always been
easy to see things simply as it was then in our first joy,
those words of hers have come back to me and given me
that same soft tug at my heart. To hurt her would be to
strike a child, to wring the neck of a bird that nestled in
your hand. There are a good many kinds of love in this
world, as there are of hate; perhaps about the best of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is this desire to protect and cherish a woman&mdash;the feeling
that any man who is worth his salt has for the one
he wants to marry....</p>

<p>Sarah walked part way back to the office with me that
morning, then turned north, saying she must try to find
Mrs. Dround and tell her. She was so happy she
couldn't go home and sit down quietly until I got back
from the office. Mrs. Dround, she knew, would be
specially glad to hear the news.</p>

<p>"For she thinks you are a very smart young man,"
Sarah added shyly.</p>

<p>"The lady must be a mind reader, then; for in the ten
years I have been with the firm I can't remember seeing
her once."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she has seen you. She said so. Anyway,
Jane knows all about you, you may be sure. There isn't
much that goes on around her that Jane doesn't know
about."</p>

<p>With that she gave me a happy little nod and was off
to the great stone house of my boss up north on the lake.
It was a windy, dirty December day, but I was very content
with the world as it was and thought Chicago was
the finest city in the world. As I sat down to my desk
my mind began to dance in a whirl of thoughts&mdash;of old
plans and new combinations. I wondered what Sarah
would say to some of my schemes to make our fortune.
Perhaps they would merely frighten her; for a woman is
a natural conservative. I hurried up my business to get
back to her and tell her that some day, not so very
distant, she would be a tolerably rich woman. For now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it seemed only a step into the greater things I had seen
all these years afar off.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Drounds gave us a dinner not long afterward.
I reached the house early, expecting to have a little time
with Sarah before the others came. Pretty soon I heard
the rustle of skirts, but, instead of Sarah, a tall, thin
woman in a black lace evening-dress came into the room
where the servant had left me. Instantly I knew that
this was the face I had seen in the carriage the morning
after the anarchist riot. She was a beautiful woman,
with a dark, almost foreign look. She smiled cordially
as she gave me her hand.</p>

<p>"Sarah is not quite ready. She wants to make herself
very fine&mdash;the child! And Mr. Dround is late, too.
I am glad, because it will give us a few minutes to ourselves.
Come into the library."</p>

<p>She led the way into a long, stately room, with a
beautiful ceiling in wood and gold. At one end, in a
little arched recess, a wood fire was blazing. There
were a number of large paintings on the walls, and
queer Eastern idols and curios in cabinets. Mr.
Dround had the reputation of being something of a
traveller and collector. My first glance around that
room explained a good deal to me about the head of
our firm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround seated herself near the fire, where the
light from a great candelabrum filled with candles
flickered above her head. Her dark eyes gleamed
under the black hair; it was a puzzle of a face!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>She began pretty soon to talk of Sarah in a natural
but terribly shrewd way.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Mr. Harrington, if you know your treasure,"
she said, half laughing. "It takes most men years
to know the woman they marry, if they ever do."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 40%;"><a name="i127" id="i127"></a>
<img src="images/i127.jpg" width="225" height="377" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>She was reading me like a book of large
print.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Well, I know
enough now to begin
with!"</p>

<p>"Sarah is such a
woman&mdash;tender, loyal,
loving. It needs a
woman to know a woman,
Mr. Harrington.
But she hasn't a particle
of practical sense:
she can't keep an account
straight. She
has no idea what
economy is&mdash;only
want or plenty. She
is Southern, so Southern!
Those people
never think what will
happen day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>It seemed queer that
she should be telling
me this kind of thing, which I should be finding out fast
enough for myself before long. Perhaps she wanted to
see what I would say; at any rate I replied clumsily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
something about not expecting to make a housekeeper
of my wife.</p>

<p>"Yet," she said slowly, studying me, "a woman can do
so much to make or mar her husband's career."</p>

<p>"I guess I shan't lay it up against my wife, if I don't
pull out a winner."</p>

<p>She laughed at that.</p>

<p>"So you think you are strong enough to win a fight
without a woman's help?"</p>

<p>"I've done it so far," I said, thinking a little of May.</p>

<p>"You have made a beginning, a good beginning," she
remarked judiciously.</p>

<p>She was reading me like a book of large print, leaning
back in her great chair, her eyes half closed, her face in
shade except when the firelight flashed.</p>

<p>"I suppose the only way is to keep on as you begin&mdash;keep
your eyes open and take everything in sight," I continued
lightly.</p>

<p>"It depends on how much you want, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I want pretty much all that I can get," I retorted
quickly, my eyes roving over the rich room, with an idea
that I might like to put Sarah in some such place as this.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround laughed a long, low laugh, as though she
were speculating why I was what I was.</p>

<p>"Well, you are strong enough, my friend, I see. As for
Sarah, love her and don't look for what you can't find."</p>

<p>Just then we heard Sarah's laugh. She came into the
room with Mr. Dround, a smile kindling graciously all
over her face. The two women, as they kissed each other,
made a picture&mdash;the dark head against the light one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Then Mrs. Dround gave Sarah a cool, motherly pat on
the cheek, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been offering your young man some advice,
Sarah."</p>

<p>"He doesn't need it!" Sarah answered in a flash.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that he does," Mrs. Dround
laughed back, kissing her again. Every one loved Sarah
in the same protecting way! Soon after this Mr. Dround
came up, smiling genially at the women's talk, and gave
me his hand.</p>

<p>I had not seen the chief out of business hours before.
I had never thought him much of a business man in the
office, and here, in his own house, with his pictures and
books and curios, he was about the last person any one
would believe spent his days over in Packington.</p>

<p>It wasn't to be a simple dinner that evening. Sarah
whispered that Jane had insisted on inviting a lot of
people, some important people, she said, to meet her
young man. And presently the guests arrived,&mdash;Lardner
and Steele and Jefferson with their wives, and a number
of others. About the only ones I knew were big John
and his very fat wife. They seemed to be as much out
of the crowd as I felt I was, with all my coolness. But
Sarah was perfectly at her ease. I admired her all afresh
when I saw how easily and gayly she took the pretty
things those men said to her.</p>

<p>I was more at my ease in the smoking room after
dinner, where I had to tell the story about the theft of
the purse in Steele's store. The shrewd old merchant
laughed heartily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i130" id="i130"></a>
<img src="images/i130.jpg" width="350" height="666" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>I have been offering your young man some advice, Sarah.</i>"
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"I trust, Mr. Harrington," he drawled, "that now you
are going to marry you will lose <i>your</i> purse there in place
of taking one."</p>

<p>They paid me considerable attention all around, and it
gave me a pleasant feeling&mdash;all of which, I knew, was
due to Sarah. I was nothing but a newcomer among them,
but she was the daughter of an old friend. And she had
a wonderful way of her own of coming close to people.</p>

<p>I remember that we went later to the opera, which was
being given in that big barn of an exposition building on
the lake front where I had had my first experience of
Chicago hospitality. We were in a box, and between
the acts people came in to call. Sarah introduced me
to some of them, and she held a reception then and there
while Mrs. Dround looked on and smiled.</p>

<p>I forget the opera that was given,&mdash;some French
thing,&mdash;but I remember how gay the place was, and
all the important people of the city whom Sarah pointed
out to me. Even as a matter of business, I saw it would
be a good thing to know these people. Of course, the
social side of life doesn't count directly in making money,
but it may count a good deal in getting close to the crowd
that knows how to make money. Perhaps I began to
have even a little more pride in Sarah than I had before,
seeing how she knew people and counted for something
with them. In the game that we were going to play
together this social business might come in handily,
perhaps.</p>

<p>In one of the intervals of the opera Mrs. Dround
remarked as if her mind had been on the same idea:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see Sarah's sphere, Mr. Harrington?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "And the girl does it tip-top!"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Of course! It's in the blood."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't a bad thing, some of it," I went on
with pride and content. "Strauss isn't here, is he?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"The Strausses never go anywhere, you know."</p>

<p>"He's the biggest of them all, too," I said partly to
myself.</p>

<p>"You think so? Why?" she asked, her brows coming
together.</p>

<p>"He's the biggest dog, and it's dog eat dog in our business,
as all over nowadays," I replied.</p>

<p>"Why now more than ever before?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's in the air. There's a change coming over business,
and you feel it the same as you feel a shift in the
wind. It's harder work fighting to live now than ever
before, and it can't go on like this forever. The big dog
will eat up the rest."</p>

<p>"And you think Strauss is our big dog?" she asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>I saw then where she had led me, but it was too late to
be less frank.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, looking her in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Then how should one keep out of his jaws?" she
went on, playing with her fan.</p>

<p>"Well, you can always get out of a scrap and stay out&mdash;or&mdash;" I
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Or?" she persisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put up such a fight that the big fellow will give you
good terms to get rid of you!"</p>

<p>"I see. You have given me something to think about,
Mr. Harrington."</p>

<p>"The time is coming," I went on, careless whether
she repeated to Mr. Dround my views, "and mighty
quick, too, when that man Strauss will have the food-products
business of this country in his fist, and the rest
of us will be his hired men, and take what he gives us!"</p>

<p>"What are you two talking about in this intimate
way?" Sarah broke in.</p>

<p>"The future," Mrs. Dround said.</p>

<p>"Business," I added.</p>

<p>"Business!" Sarah sniffed, and I knew I had done
something I ought not to do. "And Nevada singing
so divinely to-night! Come, Van, I want you to meet
Mr. Morehead." And I was led away from our hostess
to keep me out of mischief.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On our way home after the opera Sarah and I talked
of Mrs. Dround. I had never met any woman like her,
and I was loud in her praise.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sarah admitted slowly, "she seemed to like
you. But did you see how she treated the Carmichaels?
Just civil, and hardly that. Nobody can understand
Jane. She just does as she wants always."</p>

<p>"I believe she must have a great head for business.
If she were in Henry I.'s shoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't see why you say that! I am sure you never
hear the least word about business in their house."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>I smiled at Sarah's little show of temper, as she
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anyway, it would be strange if she didn't know
something about money-making. Her father was old
Joe Sanson&mdash;they say he was a half-breed and made his
money trading with the Indians and getting Government
lands. Father used to tell stories about him. We heard
that he left her a great deal of money, but nobody knows
much about her or her affairs. She's so silent."</p>

<p>"I didn't find her so."</p>

<p>Sarah apparently did not altogether share my enthusiasm
for Mrs. Dround.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she demanded, "just what she said to you,
every word."</p>

<p>"I can't. She talks with her eyes, most."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate to have men discuss business with women.
It is such bad taste!"</p>

<p>"Why, Sarah, business is the whole thing for me.
There isn't anything else I can talk about except you."</p>

<p>"Talk about me, then. I shall have to keep you out
of Jane's way. I don't want you to talk to her about
things I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She shivered and drew me closer to her.</p>

<p>"Because, Jane&mdash;I am afraid of Jane. She is so
strong, and I am so weak. If she wanted you, or anybody,
she would take you."</p>

<p>For all reply to this nonsense I kissed her good night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">MARRIAGE</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Old scenes&mdash;How home looks after the city&mdash;My sister-in-law&mdash;In
the country a man grows old&mdash;The judge once more&mdash;I
make Will a suggestion&mdash;The joy of success&mdash;My wedding

<p>Just before we were married, Sarah and I went down
to my old home in Jasonville. She was determined that
I should make it up with my folks; it hurt her gentle
heart to think that I had lived all these years without
any news of my kin. It was a freezing January day
when we drove up to the red brick house next the store.
As we rattled over the rutty streets in the depot carriage,
and passed the small frame houses all closed in for the
winter, I couldn't help feeling a most pharisaical pleasure
in knowing that I wasn't condemned to live in this bleak
little town.</p>

<p>When I knocked at the door, mother came to see who
was there. She knew me at once, but she looked at me
slowly, in the questioning way I remembered so well,
before she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Van! You've come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, and brought with me the best girl in
the world."</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you both," she said quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how's father?" I asked nervously.</p>

<p>"Your father died nearly three years ago. We didn't
know where to send word to you."</p>

<p>There was no reproach in her voice; it was as if she
expected nothing of me. We went into the house and
sat down, and began to talk. It was solemn and painful
all around, and if it hadn't been for Sarah I should have
been taking an early train for Chicago. But she was
sunny and light-hearted, and seemed to take pleasure in
being there. While we were sitting in the front room
talking to mother, a young woman came in with two
small children hiding in her skirts.</p>

<p>"Your brother Will's wife," mother explained quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, May!" I exclaimed, a little embarrassed, "I
didn't exactly look for this. Will didn't let me know&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We wanted to write you, but we didn't know where
you were. I am very glad to see you, Van," May said
quietly, a little smile curving up from her lips in a way
that reminded me of the girl I once loved. She took
both Sarah's hands and looked straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>"And this is your wife, Van?"</p>

<p>"Not quite, yet."</p>

<p>Of course I had told Sarah all about May, and I
thought she might be cold to her, meeting her in this
way of a sudden as Will's wife. She always said May
had been hard that time before&mdash;had been too keen
about her good principles to be a real woman. Yet, as
they stood there looking into each other's eyes, I could
see that they would come together very soon. Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
smiled as if to say: "It's all right, my dear! You see,
I am glad you turned him away that time. We have no
reason to quarrel, have we?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i137" id="i137"></a>
<img src="images/i137.jpg" width="390" height="577" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>I could see that they would come together very soon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>May began to blush under that smile, as though she
knew what was in Sarah's mind. Then mother brought
up May's two little boys, who went to Sarah at once.
Will was away somewhere and didn't come home until
supper. I thought he looked pretty old for his age.
Perhaps business was poor in Jasonville. The country
ages a man fast when things go hard with him. At first
he was stiffish to me, taken aback by our unexpected
visit, but pretty soon he thawed to Sarah, who talked
with him about his boys.</p>

<p>After dinner Will and I went to the barn and had a long
smoke. He told me that the judge had pressed father
pretty hard before he died, and after his death there
wasn't much saved but the store, and that was mortgaged.
And the business didn't amount to anything,
according to Will. The mail-order business had cut into
the country trade pretty badly by that time, and country
people had begun more and more to go to the city to buy
their goods. Moreover, time had shown that Jasonville
lay to one side of the main lines of traffic. In short,
Will had to scrape the barrel to get a living out of the
old store.</p>

<p>He asked how it had been with me, and it gave me
considerable pride to tell him what I had been doing. I
told him about the packing business, my sausage factory,
the deal with Strauss. He opened his eyes as he
smoked my good cigar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you struck it rich after all, Van!"</p>

<p>There was something on his mind, and after a time he
managed to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you won't have any more hard feeling for
mother and me. We all treated you pretty harsh that
time; we never gave you credit for what you had in you,
Van."</p>

<p>"I guess it would have taken a prophet to see I had
anything in me more than foolishness," I laughed.
"Anyhow, it was the best thing that ever happened to
me, Will, and I can't be too thankful that you folks in
Jasonville threw me out."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jasonville ain't just the place for an ambitious
man," he sighed. "And, Van,&mdash;about May,&mdash;it wasn't
hardly fair. She cared most for you, then, at any rate;
she wouldn't marry me, not for five years."</p>

<p>"Don't say another word, Will. May will make the
best sort of sister. She's the right kind."</p>

<p>So that was the way we made it up as two brothers
should. And the next morning, after doing some thinking
over night about how I could best help my brother
and May, I followed Will over to the store. On the way
I met the old judge, looking hardly a day older than
when I saw him last. He eyed me hard, as if he didn't
know me from the last tramp, but I stopped him and
greeted him.</p>

<p>"So you're loose once more," he grinned. "I see they
shut you up as soon as you struck Chicago." He had a
good time laughing at his little joke.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I am out once more, judge. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
from what I hear, the Harringtons have been paying you
pretty well for all the green peaches I ever took off your
place."</p>

<p>He mumbled something, but I turned on my heel,
rather proud of myself if the truth be told, being well
dressed, with an air of city prosperity.</p>

<p>Will was in the bit of an office behind the store. The
old place was as mussy and dirty as ever, with fat files
of dusty old letters and accounts. The old desk where
father used to make up his bills was littered with last
year's mail. It was Sunday, and the musty smell of the
closed store came in through the door. It all gave me the
forlornest feeling I had had in years.</p>

<p>"This will never pay, Will," I said to my brother, who
was turning the leaves of a worm-eaten day-book. "The
time when the small business would pay a man anything
worth while is pretty nearly over for good."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he replied despondently. "But somehow
we must get a living out of it."</p>

<p>"Let the judge have it, if he'll take it. I can find you
something better."</p>

<p>There was a place in Dround's that Will might work
into; and before long he could be of use to me in a
scheme that was coming around the corner of my mind
into sight. As I talked, Will's eyes brightened. Before
we left the little office a new kind of look, the look of
hope, had come over his face. I thought he seemed
already some years younger. It takes the steps of a
treadmill, downward faced, to crush the spirit in a
man!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a happy morning. Surely, one of the joys of
success is to give it away to the right ones. I remember
a good many times in my life that I have had the
pleasure of seeing that same look of hope, of a new spirit,
come into a man's face, when I gave him his chance where
he was least expecting it.</p>

<p>"But, Will, mind you, if you come to the city you'll no
longer be your own man," I cautioned him. "Dround'll
own you, or I shall. No doing what you want! To
work with me is to work under me. Can you stand
taking orders from your junior?"</p>

<p>"I guess, Van," he answered without any pride, "you
have shown yourself to be the boss. I'll follow."</p>

<p>That night, when Will and May had left us at the
junction where we were to take the Chicago train, Sarah
brushed my arm with her cheek in a little intimate way
she had and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May couldn't thank you. She feels it too much.
You have made them so happy&mdash;there's a future now
for them all. And I think, maybe, I can make you as
good a wife as she could&mdash;perhaps better, some ways.
May said so! Though May is a very nice woman, and I
shall always love her."</p>

<p>"I guess you are both right," I replied, too happy to
say much more.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A few weeks later and we were married. The Drounds
gave us a pretty little wedding breakfast, to which came
the few friends I had in the world and a few of the many
Sarah had. If Mrs. Dround was a careless hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
sometimes, that was not the day. She was specially
gracious to Will and May, who were 'most strangers. It
was all just as it should be, and I felt proud of myself to
be there and to have this handsome, high-bred woman for
my wife.</p>

<p>It was Sarah's idea that all the others should leave the
house first, and that then we should slip away quietly to
the train by ourselves. So at the last, while I was waiting
for my bride to come downstairs, Mrs. Dround and I
happened to be alone. She looked pale and worn, as if
the people had tired her. She ordered the servants to
take away the great bunches of roses that filled every
nook in the room.</p>

<p>"They are too sweet," she explained. "I like them&mdash;but
in the next room."</p>

<p>Her fastidiousness surprised me, and, as always, I began
to wonder about her. Suddenly she leaned forward
and spoke swiftly, intently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope you and Sarah will be happy together&mdash;really
happy!"</p>

<p>It was an ordinary kind of thing to say, but beneath
the plain words there seemed to lie something
personal.</p>

<p>"We shall be happy, of course!" I answered lightly.
"There's nothing against it in sight."</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend, you can't count that way! Happiness
is hard to get in this world, and you pass it by
at odd corners and never know it." She smiled a little
sadly, and then added in a more ordinary tone: "Sarah
tells me that you are to be away only a few days. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
business tempt you so much that you can't resist it
even now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I expect to love Sarah just as much when I get
back to work. Business is a man's place, as the house is
a woman's. Take either out of their places for long, and
something is likely to go wrong with them."</p>

<p>She laughed at my satisfied wisdom.</p>

<p>"Are you so needed over there in the office?"</p>

<p>"You must ask your husband that."</p>

<p>"He says that you are the cleverest man they have had
for years. Does that make you proud?"</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"Will you let the big dog Strauss eat us?" she
laughed on.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a few years later, madam."</p>

<p>"Yes," she mused, "you are right. A man, a strong
man&mdash;and that's the only kind that is a man&mdash;must be
at work. The sweetest love can't keep him long."</p>

<p>Here Sarah's voice reached us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You mustn't distract him to-day of all days, Jane!"</p>

<p>"He can't be distracted long, my child&mdash;by anybody!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We had taken a pleasant house on one of the broad
avenues to the south beyond the smoke bank, with a bit
of a garden and a few trees. When we got back from
New York we found supper waiting for us, roses on the
table, a bottle of wine ready to open, and on the sideboard
a box of cigars.</p>

<p>"The hand of Jane!" remarked my wife, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
rearranged the flowers and put the roses on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"The hand of Jane?" I repeated dully. "You mean
Mrs. Dround did it all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; it reaches everywhere."</p>

<p>And Sarah did not look as much pleased as I expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">AN HONORABLE MERCHANT</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Mr. Dround's little weakness&mdash;An unpleasant occurrence&mdash;To the
best of one's knowledge&mdash;"Kissing goes by favor," and other
things&mdash;Switch-tracks and rebates&mdash;Carmichael talks&mdash;An
item of charity&mdash;Our manager goes over to the enemy&mdash;I am
offered his place&mdash;A little talk on the moral side&mdash;The dilemma
of the righteous&mdash;What is, is good enough for me</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"Mr. Dround seems to be doing a good deal of talking
for the benefit of his neighbors," Slocum observed one
day when I was in his office.</p>

<p>"Oh, he likes the job of making the country over! It
suits him to talk more than to sell pork."</p>

<p>"Did you see what he said last night?" Slocum continued.</p>

<p>"No, what was it? Free trade or college education?"
For Mr. Henry I. Dround was long on both subjects. He
had always fooled more or less with politics, having come
out as a mugwump and free-trader under Cleveland.
That kind of doctrine wasn't much in favor among the
business men of Chicago, but Dround liked being in the
minority. He was an easy, scholarly speaker, and was
always ready to talk at dinners and public meetings.
"It seems to me I saw something in the papers of his
speaking at the Jefferson Club banquet," I went on; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
I didn't pay any attention to it. The old man is rather
long on wind."</p>

<p>"The papers missed most of the ginger. But I was
there, and it was lively. Jimmy Birdsell, Hart's man,
was there, too. It was this new Civil Service Bill that
the silk stockings are trying to push through the legislature.
Of course, Hart and the machine are fighting
it like fire. Well, your boss made the chief speech, a
good little talk, about purity and business methods in
government and the rest of it. Birdsell sat just across
the table from me, and I could see from the way he
knocked his glasses about that he was getting hot. Maybe
he came there for a fight. At last he boiled over.</p>

<p>"'Say, Mr. Dround,' he sang out in a pause between
two periods, 'how about your new switch-track over in
Ada Street?'</p>

<p>"Dround looked toward him over his glasses for a
moment, as though he hadn't heard what was said, and
then he went ahead with his talk. But Birdsell was
some drunk and too mad to care what he did. The men
beside him couldn't keep him quiet. 'I say, Dround,' he
broke out again pretty soon, 'we should like to hear what
your firm does when it wants any little favors from the
city? That might be to the point just now!'</p>

<p>"This time Dround couldn't pass it over. He took a
drink of water and his hand shook. Then he said: 'I
do not see that this is the proper time to introduce a personal
matter, but since the gentleman seems concerned
about my business honor, I am glad to set his mind at
rest. To the best of my knowledge, Henry I. Dround &amp; Co.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
have never asked and never accepted any favors from the
city. Is that satisfactory?'</p>

<p>"'Come, now, Mr. Dround,' Birdsell sneered, 'that
isn't generally believed, you know.'</p>

<p>"'I said,' your boss ripped back, '<i>to the best of my knowledge</i>,
your insinuation is a lie!' He leaned forward and
glared at Birdsell. Well, there was a kind of awkward
pause, everybody waiting to see what would come next;
and then Birdsell, who must have been pretty drunk,
called back: 'Ask your man John Carmichael what he
does when he wants anything from the city. Ask him
about your rebates, too. Then the next time you come
here telling us how to be good, you'll know more.' There
was a cat-and-dog time after that, some yelling to put
Birdsell out, and others laughing and clapping."</p>

<p>Slocum paused, and then added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It put Mr. Dround in a tight place."</p>

<p>"What of it, anyhow?" said I. "Birdsell is nothing
but a yellow dog. Hart keeps him to lick his platters.
Every one knows that."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. But he said what most every one
believes is true."</p>

<p>"That kissing goes by favor, and most other things in
this world, too. Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>Slocum leaned back in his chair and laughed. Then
he said to me seriously:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You aren't much troubled with scruples, Van!"</p>

<p>"Come, what's the use of talking good? You and I
know well enough that there isn't any other way of doing
business, not in any city in the country. You have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to pay for what you get, the same as elsewhere. Dround
ought to know it, too, by this time, and not go 'round
preaching loose&mdash;or else get out of business, which
might be better!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i148" id="i148"></a>
<img src="images/i148.jpg" width="390" height="400" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>You aren't much troubled with scruples, Van!</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"I suppose so," Slocum replied solemnly. "But I always
liked his sermons. Perhaps you and Carmichael
could tone him down a bit just now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, John don't mind his speeches, so long as he don't
interfere with the business!"</p>

<p>We went out to lunch, and talked of other matters, and
for several days I thought no more of the incident that
Slocum had related. The switch-track business did not
seem to me important. If the reformers wanted to get
after us, or any other big firm, there were many more
vulnerable points than that. Special privileges from the
city we regarded as our rights. But there was the graft
of railroad rates. Any fool could tell that, at the published
tariff rates, there would be little business for the
packers outside of Chicago. It was common knowledge
that the trade was honeycombed with private agreements
and rebate privileges, and that the fiercest part of the
business was to get the right rate from the roads. Then
there were the secret agreements between the packers,
which were all illegal, but necessary to keep the trade
from cutting prices all the time.</p>

<p>Carmichael attended to this end of the business for
Dround, as he did of everything of real importance. He
was a member of the firm now, and the wonder to me was
that this smart Irishman could put up with Dround. It
could hardly be a matter of sentiment with him. I had
a warm feeling for the illiterate junior member, with a
temper about an inch long, but a big, round heart open
to any friend. He had bucked his way up in the world
by main force, and I admired him. Besides, he had
taught me how to eat, so to speak. In a word, I liked
his way of doing things better than Mr. Dround's college
talk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, it happened that the cur Birdsell set some of the
civil service reformers on the tracks of Brother Dround,
and they got a smart newspaper reporter to work over the
whole matter. There was a lively write-up in one of the
papers, all about our switch-track over in Ada Street, with
photographs and figures, and a lot more about the way
the packers did business with the city. When I read the
piece in the paper I took the trouble to pass by our new
warehouse on my way to the office. The trackage was in,
sure enough. Carmichael was just the man to have a
thing done and settled by the time the public got around
to talk about it!</p>

<p>Mr. Dround was in his office bright and early this morning,
and sent for me.</p>

<p>"Harrington," he began, "what do you know about this
talk in the papers?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround seemed very nervous, not sure of himself.</p>

<p>"Why," I smiled, "I don't know much more than
what the papers said. Mr. Carmichael, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Dround interrupted impatiently, "Mr. Carmichael
is in New York, gets back this morning; but I
thought you might&mdash;" He hesitated, not wishing to admit
his own ignorance. "I will send for you later when
Mr. Carmichael comes in," he concluded.</p>

<p>So when John arrived he had us both in his office.</p>

<p>"You want to see me?" Carmichael asked gruffly, as
if he hadn't much time that morning to waste on the
senior member.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish to talk over certain matters that concern
us all, even though they may have no immediate bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
upon the business." Mr. Dround always talked like that
when he got the least nervous.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" Carmichael asked. He had just
arrived, and I suppose his letters interested him more
than Mr. Dround's talk.</p>

<p>"You may not have seen the articles in the morning
papers&mdash;about&mdash;about certain privileges which it is
alleged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are the boys yapping about now?" Carmichael
demanded, taking up a newspaper from the desk and
thrusting his shoulders forward in an ugly fashion.</p>

<p>"It concerns our permit to lay that new switch-track,"
Mr. Dround explained.</p>

<p>Carmichael laid the paper down and looked at the
senior member in a curious way, as if he were trying to
make out just what kind of a fool he had to deal with.
But as he said nothing, Mr. Dround continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Recently I had occasion to deny categorically that,
so far as I knew, our firm ever made any such kind of
arrangement as is here described. My word was challenged.
It was a very painful situation, I need not say.
Since then I have been thinking&mdash;I have been wondering
whether this charge&mdash;"</p>

<p>He floundered pitifully, disliking to mouth the dreadful
words. John helped him out brutally:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You wonder whether we had to grease anybody's
paw about that switch-track over in Ada Street?"</p>

<p>Dround nodded. "The papers say so!"</p>

<p>"They have to print something, don't they? What
harm does that do us? I wouldn't trust the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
d&mdash;&mdash;n bunch of papers with a ten-dollar bill. They're
a lot of blackmailers&mdash;that's what they are!"</p>

<p>John bit off the end of a cigar and spat it out in front
of Mr. Dround.</p>

<p>"We are not concerned with the newspapers or their
motives, Mr. Carmichael," the senior member observed
with considerable dignity. "What I want is your assurance
that this firm&mdash;that, so far as we are concerned,
this accusation is false."</p>

<p>We waited for the Irishman's reply. It would be an
easy matter to tell a fib and set Mr. Dround's mind at
rest. But Carmichael seemed to be in a specially bad
temper this morning. When he went to New York he
was accustomed to enjoy himself, and it was not the
right time to badger a man just off the cars. Pretty soon
John said fiercely:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's my business to look after such matters?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround nodded.</p>

<p>"Don't I do it satisfactorily?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround waived this point.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll have to be content with that."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carmichael," the senior member leaped to his
feet, "you forget yourself! You will be good enough to
answer me yes or no, to my direct question. Did you or
did you not pay money for this privilege?"</p>

<p>Carmichael's voice shook as he replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, Dround! If you don't know your own
business enough to know the answer, I don't see why I
should tell you." His temper was going with every

There hasn't been such a thing as a private switch-track
put down in this city since you began doing business for
less than seven thousand dollars. I paid the right people
ninety-five hundred dollars for ours. There, you've got
it! Now what are you going to do about it?"</p>

</div>

<p>The big Irishman plumped his two red fists on Mr.
Dround's desk and glared at him. At that moment I
pitied the old gentleman heartily; he was never born to
do business, at least in our day. He seemed to shrivel
up under Carmichael's words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"How, may I ask," he said at last in a low tone, "was
this done without my knowledge? How does it appear
on the books?"</p>

<p>Carmichael laughed at the simple question.</p>

<p>"Charity! We are a very charitable concern!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround's lips trembled, and he cried out rather
than spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, never! Better to fail! Better to go bankrupt
at once!"</p>

<p>He was talking to himself. Then he recollected us
and said with dignity:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That is all, Mr. Carmichael. After this I shall
attend to all such matters myself. Good morning,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>He sat down at his desk, dismissing us. Carmichael
was shaking with anger.</p>

<p>"No!" he cried, "it isn't all! Turn me out of your
office like a boy, with my orders, when it's me that
have stood between you and ruin any day these ten
years! What would your business be worth if it weren't
for John Carmichael? Ask Harrington here. Go out
and ask your bank&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe we need to discuss this any further&mdash;"
Mr. Dround began.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will! Get somebody else to do your dirty
business for you. For, let me tell you right here, Henry
I. Dround, that I don't go broke with you, not for all
your college talk and prin-ci-ples."</p>

<p>Mr. Dround pointed to the door. He was trembling
again. I took the big Irishman by the arm and led him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
from the office. Outside the door he shook me off, and
hurled himself into his own office.</p>

<p>That was the first wind of the storm, and the rest
wasn't long in coming. Somebody told me that Carmichael
had been seen with one of Strauss's lieutenants
going into a law office that did some of the big packer's
work. It looked as though he were making a deal with
the Strauss crowd. It seemed natural enough to me that
Carmichael should do this, but I was sorry for what must
come. Meantime, Mr. Dround was more assiduous at
business than I had ever known him to be. He came
early, and instead of driving over to his club for luncheon
took a bite in his office, and put in the afternoons going
into all departments of the business.</p>

<p>In the end, the trouble came to a head in this way: in
company with every large shipper at that period we
made our bargain with the roads; no large firm and no
railroad pretended to live up to the law in the matter
of rates. The roads sold their transportation, as we
sold ribs and lard&mdash;for the highest figure they could
get. Before any considerable contract was entered into
the thrifty shipper saw to his rate in advance. And
some time later there came along from the railroad that
got the business a check in the way of "adjustment."
The senior member, in his new energy, discovered one
of these rebates. He sent it back to the traffic manager
of the road with a letter such as the roads were not in
the habit of getting from their favored shippers. The
second vice-president and general traffic manager of that
line attended the same church the Drounds went to, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the president of the road, also, was one of Dround's
friends. I wonder what they thought when their attention
was called to this little matter!</p>

<p>Carmichael told me what had happened with a wicked
grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Righteous man, Henry I. Dround, all right! D&mdash;&mdash;n
good business man, too," he commented. "What do you
think is going to happen to this concern? He's chucked
away the profits of that contract!"</p>

<p>"You aren't planning to stay, John?" I remarked
casually.</p>

<p>He looked at me and laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you want to come with me when I get out?"</p>

<p>I smiled, but said nothing. There was no open row
between Mr. Dround and the junior member of the firm
this time. But a few weeks later Mr. Dround told me
what I already knew&mdash;that he and Carmichael were
about to part. I advised him bluntly to make it up with
the Irishman if he could,&mdash;not to part with him at any
cost.</p>

<p>"For, Mr. Dround, you will find him fighting on the
other side; Strauss will have him."</p>

<p>He knew as well as I what that meant to his business,
but he said with new determination:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Carmichael and I can never do business together
again."</p>

<p>Then he offered to take me into partnership on the
same basis that Carmichael had. I suppose he expected
me to jump at my chance, but the prospect was not
altogether inviting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ought to say, Mr. Dround," I replied hesitatingly,
"that I think Carmichael was right in this rebate business,
and in the other matter, too. If I had been in his
place I should have done the same thing&mdash;any man
would. It's against human nature to sit still and be
eaten alive!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dround's eyes lowered, and he turned his face
away from me. His spirit was somewhat daunted: perhaps
he began to realize what it meant to stand out
alone against the commercial system of the age. Nevertheless,
he said some things, perfectly true, about the
honor and integrity of his firm. As it had been handed
over to him by his father, so he would keep it, please God.</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said a little impatiently. "That
might do in times gone by. But Carmichael and I have
got to live in the present. That means a fight. I would
like to stay on and fight it out with you. But I can't see
the use on your basis. Look!"</p>

<p>I pointed out of his window to a new refrigerator building
that Strauss was putting up under our noses.</p>

<p>"That is only one: you know the others. He is growing
every day. You can't expect us to sit here twiddling
our thumbs and thinking of our virtue while he gets the
business! Better to sell out to Strauss right here and
now, while there is something to sell."</p>

<p>"Never!" Mr. Dround cried with unaccustomed vehemence.
"Never to him!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, we've got our work cut out for us, and let
us waste no more time talking rebates and the rest of it."</p>

<p>"Yet that horrid scandal about the switch-track," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
resumed in his old weak way. "Nothing has done so
much to hurt my position in the city as that!"</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do about it?" I asked in
Carmichael's very words. "Those thieves over there in
the council hold you up. What good does it do the public
for you to refuse their price? It's like paying for the
right to put up a house on your own lot&mdash;it's tough, but
you had better pay and not worry."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harrington, I refuse to believe that in our country
an honorable business cannot be conducted successfully
by honorable methods."</p>

<p>"That depends on what you choose to call honorable
methods. At any rate," I concluded in disgust, "you are
likely to have a good chance to try that proposition to
the bitter end, unless you take my advice and sell to your
chief competitor."</p>

<p>He waived this aside impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, then, look for the fight of your life just to survive,
not to make money. I tell you, Mr. Dround, Strauss
is out there waiting to eat us all up. And you have
thrown him your general for a beginning."</p>

<p>"But I trust that I have another as good or better," he
said with his usual flourish of courtesy.</p>

<p>We had some more talk, he urging me to stay with
him, although I let him see plainly where I stood on the
matter of rebates, private agreements, and all the rest
of the underground machinery of business.</p>

<p>"If I take your offer," I said at last, "I shall use the
old weapons&mdash;you must know that. There are no morals
in business that I recognize except those that are written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
on the statute book. It is dog eat dog, Mr. Dround, and
I don't propose to be the dog that's eaten."</p>

<p>Even then he did not stop urging me, salving his conscience
by saying: "It saddens me to hear as young a
man as you take that cynical view. It is a strange
time we are coming to. I pray it may not be a worse
time for the country!"</p>

<p>To my mind there was something childish in the use of
those words "better" and "worse." Every age is a new
one, and to live in any age you have got to have the
fingers and toes necessary for that age. The forces which
lie in us and make those triumph who do triumph in the
struggle have been in men from the beginning of time.
There's little use in trying to stop their sweep, or to sit
and cry like Dround by the roadside, because you don't
like the game. For my part, I went with the forces that
are, willingly, gladly, believing in them no matter how
ugly they might look. So history reads: the men who
lead accept the conditions of their day. And the others
follow along just the same; while the world works and
changes and makes itself over according to its destiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE WILL OF A WOMAN</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>A family scene&mdash;Sarah's ideas&mdash;We dine&mdash;Carmichael comes
in&mdash;Visions of empire&mdash;Almost persuaded&mdash;Common people&mdash;The
touch of mind and mind&mdash;Mr. Dround becomes ill, and
we miss Big John&mdash;The garden by the lake&mdash;A bit of old
marble and other things&mdash;Inspiration&mdash;Outlining a campaign&mdash;The
big gamble</i></p></blockquote>


<p>After all, it was the will of a woman, perhaps of two
women, that settled this business matter, for even in
business&mdash;in the groping for position and money&mdash;the
woman's share is large. Wherever a man's will is in
play she brings her influence, soft and sure and hidden.</p>

<p>When I left Mr. Dround that afternoon I was not
ready to put the little fortune I had made, and, what was
more, my life energy, into his forlorn enterprise. Not to
hurt his feelings, I asked for time to consider his offer,
and went home to tell my wife about the change in our
affairs, considerably puzzled what to do. We had just
moved into a larger house near the lake; the place had
some pretty ground around it, and a large stable. It was
all that our means warranted, and a little more. But
Sarah had a passion for having people about, and there
was a boy now to be considered. The air was supposed
to be better for him farther away from the city smoke.
Sarah had been delicate and nervous ever since the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
was born, and I was glad to have her mind busy with the
big new plaything.</p>

<p>A nurse in uniform was just coming into the gate when
I arrived. It seems that little Ned had a cold, and
though he looked lively enough when I went into his
room, Sarah was hovering over him as if he had lung
trouble.</p>

<p>"The doctor thought I should have a trained nurse,"
Sarah explained. "Of course he doesn't expect any
serious results, but one should take every precaution.
And Mary is so careless, and we have those people
coming to dinner to-night, and are going to the theatre."</p>

<p>I had forgotten that we were to have guests this evening.
While we were dressing, I told Sarah about the
trouble between Dround and his old manager, and how
they had finally parted.</p>

<p>"That's just what I should have expected from Mr.
Dround!" my wife exclaimed approvingly. "It must have
been annoying for Mr. Dround to have such a dishonest
person connected with him."</p>

<p>"Well, that is one way of looking at it I hadn't
thought of!" I laughed.</p>

<p>"That Carmichael man is just an Irish brute! I suppose
you have to put up with such people in the packing
business, but I couldn't have them in my house."</p>

<p>"The Carmichaels don't trouble us much," I replied,
smiling to myself at Sarah's ideas of things. "And
John's all right&mdash;as honest as most men. This isn't
just a case of stealing somebody's wash from the back
yard, you know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's just as wrong! It's dishonest!" she cried
with a proud tone in her voice. She came across the
room and took hold of me by the shoulders. "Van, you
don't believe in bribing people and such things? Why,
you're too big and strong and handsome"&mdash;she gave me
a kiss&mdash;"to do such common things!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; it depends how you call it."</p>

<p>But she gave me another kiss, and before we could
recover from this argument there was a knock at the
dressing-room door.</p>

<p>"My, Van! There's the first of them, and I haven't
my dress hooked. You run and send Mary to me!"
That rather closed the topic for the present.</p>

<p>There were ten of us at dinner, and we tried to keep
up a chatter about the little things that Sarah had trained
me to talk of when I was in company&mdash;the theatres and
the opera, Mrs. Doodle's new place in the country, or
old Steele's picture by the French painter. But to-night
it was hard work: my thoughts would wander back to
the Yards. At last the ladies left us to put on their
wraps, and the men were lighting their cigars, when a
servant told me that a man was waiting in the hall to
see me. It was Carmichael.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come right out, John?" I exclaimed.
"Some of your friends are out there."</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Van," he growled. "I ain't got my fancy
clothes on this trip, and maybe your wife wouldn't think
me good enough for her friends" (which was pretty close
to the truth). "But I come to see you about something
important."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah rustled into the hall just then.</p>

<p>"Van!" she said, bowing coldly to John, "we are all
waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Better go, Harrington," Carmichael said sarcastically,
reaching for his hat; "business don't count when there's
a party goin' on."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's business!" Sarah's voice could carry a deal
of scorn.</p>

<p>"Leave a ticket for me and I'll follow later,"
I replied impatiently, leading Carmichael into my
library.</p>

<p>"Very well," Sarah answered, and swept out of the hall
without a look for the Irishman.</p>

<p>Carmichael took a cigar, poured out a long drink of
whiskey, and thrust his ungainly figure into a chair
before the fire without saying a word. After a time
he ripped out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You aren't thinking of staying with old Dround?"</p>

<p>"That depends&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Dround'll go broke inside of two years," he interrupted
savagely. "His credit ain't much to boast of
now, and when it gets around that I have drawn out,
it won't improve."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," I admitted.</p>

<p>"The London and Chicago Company is going into the
hands of receivers this week," he went on confidentially.
"That was another of your tony houses managed from
England! Strauss'll most likely get their plants at
twenty cents on the dollar, and he'll get Dround when
the time comes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>I made no remark, and after smoking for a time he
leaned over toward me, saying impressively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Young feller, do you reckon you can buck up against
me and the Strauss crowd with that one-horse rig?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i164" id="i164"></a>
<img src="images/i164.jpg" width="450" height="254" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>Young feller, do you reckon you can buck up against me and
the Strauss crowd with that one-horse rig?</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>It seemed to me highly improbable that any man could
perform this feat, but I held my tongue. Carmichael
should make his bid in his own way. Finally he whispered
almost solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Want to make big money?"</p>

<p>And he began to bid, lowering his loud voice and beating
the arm of his chair to clinch his argument. He spoke
of the great revolution throughout the business world,
coming consolidations, far-reaching plans that the Strauss
people had had in mind for a long time, the control of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
railroads and steamship lines&mdash;all leading to one conclusion,
one end&mdash;the complete mastery of food products
by Strauss and his allies.</p>

<p>We had in more whiskey and cigars for the Irishman,
who had a head like a rock. As he drank and talked,
his brain was fired by a kind of rude imagination for the
vast reach of what he saw. He opened himself to me
without reserve, as if he already held me in his hand.
The hours sped by; a carriage drove up to the house, and
I knew that Sarah had returned from the theatre. But
Carmichael talked on. Through his words I could see
those vast industrial forces that had been shaping themselves
for ages now fast rushing on toward their fulfilment.
Ever since my head had been above the horizon,
so to speak, I had seen straws borne on this wind. But
now the mighty change was imminent; those who survived
another decade would look out upon a very different
world from that we had grown up with. That is what
Carmichael and I saw that night, and when the door
finally closed on my visitor I felt that it was settled: I
should fight with the stronger army, side by side with
Carmichael....</p>

<p>I was standing before the dead fire, thinking, when
the door opened and Sarah came in, her hair loosened
over her white dressing-gown. She looked strangely
pale and troubled.</p>

<p>"Van!" she cried sharply. "What have you to do
with that dishonest Carmichael? What business has he
with you? He makes me afraid; and you never came
to the theatre at all!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're dreaming, Sal." I took her on my knee.
"John just came to tell me how to make your everlasting
fortune."</p>

<p>"But you are not to leave Mr. Dround?"</p>

<p>"Just that."</p>

<p>"Leave Mr. Dround and go with that dishonest man!
What are you thinking of, Van Harrington?"</p>

<p>That instinct of women, which people talk about, sometimes
acts like a fog: it keeps them from seeing any one
thing clearly. Sarah could only see the Drounds and the
piece in the paper about bribing. So we talked it over,
like husband and wife, arriving nowhere in particular,
and finally I said at random:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You would like to be rich, to have a lot of money,
more than you ever thought to have&mdash;millions, maybe?"</p>

<p>"Would it mean all that?" she asked slowly.</p>

<p>I laughed at the way she took my bait.</p>

<p>"Millions and millions, maybe."</p>

<p>"Would it be dishonest, Van?"</p>

<p>"We don't calculate on going to prison," I joked.</p>

<p>"Well," she reflected, "of course you know best. I
don't believe a woman should interfere in her husband's
business.  But the Carmichaels and the Strausses are
such common people, even if they are so awfully rich.
They haven't the position the Drounds have."</p>

<p>When it came to that I kissed her and put out the
lights.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In this life few intimacies fill the full orb of a man's
being. Most men of affairs whom I have known, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
wisely shut down their desks before coming home, and
shut therein a good slice of themselves. Perhaps they do
not care to trust any one, even a wife, with their secrets.
Perhaps they do not need to share those restless hours of
anxiety that come to all men who go into the market to
make money. The wife should mean peace and affection:
that is right and proper. Nevertheless, there come
times when a man must talk out his whole soul to one
who understands the language of it. For he hungers to
say to another what he scarcely dares say to himself, what
is shut up in the dark of his thoughts. It is not advice
that he needs, but sympathy&mdash;to reveal to another that
web of purpose which he has woven, which is himself.
Many a man who has carried burdens silently long years
knows what I mean. The touch of hand to hand is
much: the touch of mind with mind is more.</p>

<p>Not that Sarah and I failed to be good married lovers.
She was my dear wife. But there are some last honesties
that even a wife penetrates not&mdash;moments when
the building of years is shaking in the storm; moments
of loneliness, when mad thoughts arise in a sober head,
and a man gropes to find what there is not even in the
heart of the woman he loves.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dround was not at the office the next morning: they
telephoned from his house that he was ill. Worry, perhaps,
had brought on one of his nervous attacks. Meantime,
it was easy to see the effect of Carmichael's loss all
over the place. Down to the girls in the mailing room,
the force knew that something was wrong with the concern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
You can't keep real news from spreading: people are
good conductors of electricity; their thoughts leak. In
any business, the trouble at the head runs all along the
line to the office boys.</p>

<p>Later in the day there came a message from Mr.
Dround asking to see me at his house before I went
home. It was plain enough what he wanted of me, and
I disliked the coming interview. For I should have to
tell him that I had decided to desert to his enemies.
There was no other way, as I saw it. And yet it seemed
like ingratitude. That was what his wife would think,
and I saw her looking at me, a scornful smile on her lips.
However, this was no matter for sentiment. If her husband
had been another sort of man,&mdash;if he had any
dare in him,&mdash;it might have been worth while to try
a fall with Carmichael and Strauss. But as it was, I
felt no desire to follow a funeral. Maybe she would
understand....</p>

<p>As I turned into the avenue near Dround's house there
was a fresh little breeze from the lake, blowing the smoke
away from the city and cooling the air after the warm
day. It was quiet and peaceful on the broad avenue&mdash;a
very different kind of place from the dirty Yards whence
I had come. It made me feel all the more that Dround
didn't belong in Packington.</p>

<p>I sat waiting some time for Mr. Dround, and was growing
impatient when his wife came into the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dround is engaged with his doctor," she said.
"Won't you step into the garden with me?"</p>

<p>Behind the house, hidden from a cross street by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
brick wall, was a little green lawn with one old willow
tree. It was a pretty, restful kind of place, hardly to be
looked for so near the heart of the city. In one corner
there was a stone bench and some chairs, and a table
with books and tea things. Across the top of the wall
one could see a line of gray where the horizon met the
lake.</p>

<p>"Pleasant place!" I exclaimed, looking across the
little garden out to the lake.</p>

<p>"Yes, it makes the city in summer tolerable."</p>

<p>Her eyes followed mine as they rested on a bit of
marble, old and sculptured with yellow figures, that had
been set into the wall.</p>

<p>"I brought that from Siena," she explained. "It was
in an old wall there. It reminds me of Italy," she
added, touching the marble lightly with her fingers.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned to me with a swift question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you're to be our new Mr. Carmichael?"</p>

<p>It was not woman's mere haphazard quizzing: she demanded
the truth.</p>

<p>"No," I replied gravely, after a moment's hesitation.
"Mrs. Dround, I have come here to tell Mr. Dround that
I must decline his offer. I have other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are going over to them!" she cried quickly.
There was no reproach in her voice, but she gave me
a keen look that read to the bottom of my mind. "You
will be a tool for the Jew and the Irishman!" There
was a smile on her lips and a touch of scorn in her voice.
"Tell me, why?"</p>

<p>And I told her, as I might a man whom I trusted, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
what the situation was&mdash;how disastrous had been the
row with Carmichael, and how foolish the cause, as I
thought. She listened without questions, and I went on
to cover the whole matter&mdash;to tell of the large plans
that our great rival undoubtedly had in view, plans
which meant ultimately the consolidation of the entire
business in some great corporation under his control. It
was as clear to me as handwriting what he was aiming
for&mdash;the entire food-products business of the country;
and it would take a stronger man than Henry I. Dround
to stand against him.</p>

<p>"So, Mrs. Dround," I concluded, "the best thing you
and I can do for Mr. Dround is to advise him to retire,
to sell out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He would never do that," she interrupted me quietly.</p>

<p>"You must make him see it," I urged.</p>

<p>"There are some things I cannot do. You will not
understand; I cannot tell you&mdash;it is not my right. Only
he will go on to the bitter end."</p>

<p>I bowed. There was nothing further to be said, and
we sat silently for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"But are you sure," she began again, "that that would
be the best way? Is it best to run to your enemy, crying
for quarter?"</p>

<p>"Not if you can put up a good fight!"</p>

<p>She drew her fingers caressingly over the outlines
of the old marble.</p>

<p>"I think you could put up the right kind of a fight,"
she remarked quietly. "Suppose that you saw your way
clear to go in&mdash;to fight&mdash;what would you do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"The first thing," I said, smiling, "would be to hit
Strauss between the eyes."</p>

"I think you could put up the right kind of a fight," she
remarked quietly.</p>
</div>

<p>"Just how?"</p>

<p>"Do what he is doing, if I could: get together all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
independent concerns that could be bought or persuaded
into joining. Then you would be in a position to make
terms with the railroads and force agreements from the
big fellows. And I shouldn't let my scruples stand in
the way, either," I added hardily.</p>

<p>"Naturally not&mdash;if the others were the same kind!"</p>

<p>"And if your husband were made like you," I thought
to myself, "the chance would be worth the trying."
"If," I continued aloud, "you could get the Jevons
Brothers, the E.H. Harris Company, Griscom, in Omaha,
and two or three others, there would be a beginning.
And there is this London and Chicago concern, which
could be had cheap," I mused half to myself, remembering
Carmichael's words.</p>

<p>"I was sure you knew what must be done," she took
me up in the same cool, assured tone. "You aren't the
man to follow in the traces. You are the kind that
leads, that builds. And this is building! What is the
first step?"</p>

<p>I looked at her, but this time I did not laugh. She
had risen from the stone bench and stood gazing out
across the quiet sward to the blue lake beyond. Her
dark features were alight with enthusiasm. Then she
looked over at me inquiringly, expecting me to take her
lead, to walk on boldly with her.</p>

<p>And there of a sudden&mdash;for until that moment there
was nothing in my mind but to tell Mr. Dround that I
was to leave him&mdash;there shot into my head a plan of
how this thing might be handled, the sketch of a great
campaign. All the seeds of thought, the full years'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
schemings, the knowledge and experience of life I had
been getting&mdash;everything that was within me came
surging up into one grand purpose. How it came to
me of a sudden, born of a few words this woman had
spoken here in the garden by the blue lake, is beyond
my explanation. Suddenly I saw a way, clear and broad
ahead&mdash;the way for me to travel.</p>

<p>"You will have to take the first steps by yourself&mdash;manage
this London and Chicago Company affair on
your own responsibility." Mrs. Dround's voice was
now matter-of-fact, as though the time for clear thinking
had come. "Then, when you have your plans ready&mdash;know
just what must be done&mdash;you will have the necessary
help. I can promise that!"</p>

<p>I understood what she meant&mdash;that Mr. Dround was
not to be approached until the scheme was ripe. Then
she would swing him to a decision. That was the wise
way.</p>

<p>"You are right," I agreed. "It would be useless to
trouble him until the land is mapped. When it comes to
forming the company&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, then," she interrupted, seeing my point. "Then
I shall be of use."</p>

<p>"My,&mdash;but it's a big gamble!" I said low to myself.</p>

<p>"That is the only kind worth making!" she flashed.</p>

<p>It struck the right note in my heart. She held out
her hand, and I took it in mine.</p>

<p>"We're partners on this thing!" I smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to the end. Now, shall we go to Mr.
Dround?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was a woman who should have headed a regiment,
or run a railroad, or sat at a game with a large
stake!</p>

<p>Mr. Dround opened the door on the veranda and came
forward, walking feebly.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Harrington?" He greeted me, giving
me a thin, feverish hand. "The doctor's been gone
a good while, Jane," he added querulously. "I have
been waiting for you in the library."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround moved away while we discussed some matters
of urgency, and then Mr. Dround said hesitantly:
"I hope you see your way clear, Harrington, to accepting
my offer. It promises a great future for a man as
young as you, with your energy," he added a trifle
pompously.</p>

<p>"It is pretty late to talk of that to-night," I replied,
evasively.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround was walking slowly toward us; she
stopped by the marble piece in the wall and seemed to
be examining it. But I knew that she was listening.</p>

<p>"There are some plans I want to talk over with you
first. If they prove satisfactory to you, we could make
an arrangement, perhaps."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround turned her head and looked at us
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well; I expect to be at the office to-morrow.
This Commission for the Exposition takes a great deal of
my time and energy just now." (It was the year before
the great Fair, and Mr. Dround was one of the Commissioners
for that enterprise.) "But we will take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
your plans at once," he concluded graciously, giving me
his hand.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There was a family party at my house that evening.
Will had arrived from Texas, where he had been to look
over the field for me, and May was visiting us with her
children. As I walked up the path to the house on my
return from Mr. Dround's, I could hear Sarah's low
laugh. She and May were rocking back and forth
behind the vines of the piazza, watching the children
at their supper. May was looking almost plump and
had a pleasant flush on either cheek; for good times
had made her blossom out. But Sarah was the handsomer
woman, with her wavy, rich brown hair and soft
profile. Instead of May's prim little mouth, her lips
were always half open, ready to smile. As I kissed her,
she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Van?"</p>

<p>"Seeing some one."</p>

<p>"I know," she said with a pout. "You have been
with that horrid Irishman. Well, I hope you made him
give you just loads of money."</p>

<p>"But suppose I haven't been to see John?" I asked
laughingly, thinking she would be delighted to find out
I was to keep on with Dround. "Suppose I took your
advice?"</p>

<p>"What! Are you going to stay with Mr. Dround, after
all? And all that money you were telling me about&mdash;millions!"
she drawled in her soft voice like a disappointed
child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed troubled to know that after all I had
given up my chance to make money with Strauss and
Carmichael.</p>

<p>"I guess we shan't starve, Sarah," I laughed back.</p>

<p>"You must do what you think best," she said finally,
and repeated her favorite maxim, "I don't believe in a
woman's interfering in a man's business."</p>

<p>After supper, as we sat out in the warm night, Will
talked of his trip through the Southwest.</p>

<p>"It's a mighty big country down there, and not
touched. You folks up North here haven't begun to see
what is coming to that country. It's the new promised
land!"</p>

<p>And he went raving on in the style I love to hear, with
the sunshine of great lands on his face and the wind from
the prairies blowing low in his voice. It was like music
that set my thoughts in flow, and I began to see my
scheme unfold, stretch out, embrace this new fertile
country, reach on to foreign shores.... Then my
thoughts went back to the garden by the lake, with the
piece of yellow marble in the wall.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty little place the Drounds have behind
their house," I remarked vaguely to Sarah in a pause of
Will's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in the Drounds' garden?"
Sarah asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, talking business!"</p>

<p>"It's a queer place to talk business."</p>

<p>"It's a pretty place, and there's a piece of marble in
the wall they got in Italy&mdash;Siena, or some such place."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you were talking business with Jane?" Sarah
persisted.</p>

<p>"Well, you can call it that. Tell me more about that
country, Will. Maybe the future will take us there."</p>

<p>In the warm, peaceful evening, with a good cigar, anything
seemed possible. While the women talked of
schools and the children's clothes, I saw visions of the
coming year&mdash;of the great gamble!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="chap">THE FIRST MOVE</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The Chicago and London Packing Company&mdash;Bidding for bonds&mdash;A
man named Lokes&mdash;A consideration for services performed&mdash;Bribery&mdash;A
sheriff's sale&mdash;We take the trick&mdash;The
tail of a snake&mdash;Not a gospel game</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Slocum had been after the bondholders' protective
committee of the London and Chicago Company. There
were only a million and a half of bonds out, which,
before their smash, could be picked up for less than
twenty. Lately, on the rumor that one of the strong
Chicago houses was bidding for them, their price had
risen somewhat. The hand of Carmichael working
through one of the smaller corporations controlled by
Strauss was plain enough to one who watched, and I
resolved as the first step in my campaign to outwit my
old boss in this little deal. From the price of the bonds
it was evident that Carmichael was offering the bondholders
about twenty-five for the control. I told Slocum
to give forty and then arrange to bid the property in at
the sheriff's sale.</p>

<p>The lawyer reported that two of the bondholders'
committee were favorable to our terms: they hated the
Strauss crowd, and they were afraid to wait for better
terms, as money was hardening all the time. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
third man, who had been the treasurer of the defunct
corporation, held out for a higher figure. Slocum
thought that this man, whose name was Lokes, might
be dickering with Carmichael secretly to secure some
favors for himself in the deal. This Lokes was not
unknown to me, and I considered Slocum's suspicions
well founded. He had left behind him in Kansas City
a bad name, and here in Chicago he ran with a set of
small politicians, serving as a middleman between them
and the financial powers who used them. In short, I
knew of but one way to deal with a gentleman like Mr.
Lokes, and I had made up my mind to use that way.</p>

<p>Slocum made an appointment with Lokes in his office,
and I went there to meet him and arrange to get the
London and Chicago outfit with as little delay as possible.
Lokes was a small, smooth-shaven fellow, very well
dressed, with something the air of a horsy gentleman.
First he gave us a lot of talk about the value of the
London and Chicago properties, and the duty of his committee
to the bondholders. He and his associates had
no mind to let the property go for a song. I made up
my mind just what inducement would reach him, while
he and Slocum argued about the price of the bonds.
When Lokes began to throw out Carmichael at us, I
broke in:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Lokes, you know there isn't much in this deal
for that crowd. But I don't mind telling you frankly
that it is of prime importance to the interests we
represent."</p>

<p>Slocum looked up at me, mystified, but I went on:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"We propose to form a large packing company, into
which we shall take a number of concerns on which we
have options. We want this property first. When our
company is formed we might make it very well worth
your while having been friendly to us in this transaction."</p>

<p>Lokes didn't move a muscle: this was the talk he had
been waiting for, but he wanted to hear the figures. I
told him enough of our plans to let him see that we had
good backing and to whet his appetite.</p>

<p>"Now we have offered your committee forty cents on
the dollar for your bonds, which is fifteen more than the
other crowd will give you. If you will induce your
associates to take bonds in our corporation, we will give
you fifty, instead of forty&mdash;and," I concluded slowly,
"there will be fifty thousand dollars of preferred stock
for your services."</p>

<p>At the word "services" Slocum jumped up from the
table where he had been seated and walked over to the
window, then came back to the table, and tried to attract
my attention. But I kept my eyes on Lokes.</p>

<p>"What will you do for the others?" Lokes asked
significantly, meaning his two associates on the committee.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" I said shortly. "You will look after
them. They will do what you say. That is what we
pay for."</p>

<p>It was plain enough that I was offering him a good-sized
bribe for his services in turning over to us the assets
of the London and Chicago concern rather than to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
rivals, and for bonds in the prospective company instead
of cash. That did not trouble him: he was aware that
he had not been asked to meet me to talk of the health
of the bankrupt company of which he had been the
treasurer. Lokes thought awhile, asked some more
questions about our company, and finally hinted at his
preference for cash for his services.</p>

<p>"Either forty cash with no bonus for your services, or
fifty in bonds with the preferred stock for you," I answered
shortly.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he took his hat and said he was going to
see his associates on the committee, and would be back
in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p>"He's gone over to Carmichael," I remarked to Slocum,
when he had closed the office door behind Mr. Lokes.
"But John won't touch him&mdash;he won't believe his story.
He doesn't think I've got the cash or the nerve to play
this game. We'll see him back in an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Van, what you are doing?" Slocum
asked sombrely, instead of replying to my remark. "You
have bribed that man to betray his trust."</p>

<p>"I guess that was what he came here for, Sloco. But
we are offering them a good price for their goods. This
man Lokes happens to be a rascal. If he had been
straight, we could have saved that preferred stock.
That's all there is to it."</p>

<p>But Slocum still shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's a bad business."</p>

<p>"Well, it costs money. But I mean to put this thing
through, and you know at the best I may lose every cent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
I have made in twelve years. It's no time to be squeamish,
Slocum."</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;" he began, and paused.</p>

<p>"You wish, if there is any more of this kind of thing,
I would get some one else to do my business? But I
can't! I must have a man I can rely upon."</p>

<p>It meant a good reward for him, too, if we carried
through my great plan. But Slocum was not the one
to be reached in that way. He needed the money, and
wanted it badly, but money alone wouldn't make him
stick by me. I knew that.</p>

<p>"We'll hope this is the last," I said, after a time.
"And, besides, I take the risk. I want you, and you
won't go back on me. I need you, Slo!"</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>Sure enough, late that afternoon Slocum telephoned
me that Lokes had come back and signified his consent
and that of his associates to our terms. The bondholders
would take notes, to be converted later into
bonds of the new company at fifty cents on the dollar.
Lokes asked for some kind of agreement about the stock
he was to get for his "services," which I refused to give
him, on Slocum's advice. He had to content himself
with Slocum's statement that he was dealing with gentlemen.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>That comedy took place on the court-house steps according to law.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The next step in the proceedings was the sheriff's sale
of the defunct corporation's effects, which was ordered
by the court for the following Monday. That comedy
took place on the court-house steps according to law.
The sheriff read the decree of court to an audience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
hoboes, who were roosting on the steps, and some
passers-by halted to see the proceedings. When the
sheriff asked for bids, a little Jew lawyer in a shiny
silk hat stepped forward out of the crowd and made his
bid. This was Marx, the junior member of a firm employed
by Strauss. Just as the sheriff was about to nod
to the Jew, Slocum stepped forward with a certified
check in his hand and bid in the property for seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Marx to do; Carmichael had
given him no instructions for this contingency. He had
his orders, and he stood there with his jaw hanging,
while Slocum handed in the certified check and completed
the formality of the sale.</p>

<p>"It is fraud!" Marx shouted, shaking his fist in my
face as we left.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was right; but whatever fraud there was
in the transaction did not concern Marx or the men he
represented. They had been euchred at their own game.
And they knew it: we never heard anything more from
the Strauss crowd about the London and Chicago bonds.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got it," Slocum said, as we came away
from the sale. "I hope we won't have trouble with
Lokes."</p>

<p>"That's all right," I replied. "We've got him where
he can't make trouble."</p>

<p>"There's usually a tail to this kind of thing&mdash;you
never can tell when you have reached the end."</p>

<p>But I was too jubilant to take gloomy views. The
skirmish was over, and we were a step nearer my goal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after that I ran across John Carmichael as
I was picking my way in the muck out of the Yards. He
was driving in a little red-wheeled road wagon such as
the local agents use for running about the city. He
called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hey, Van Harrington! Come over here!"</p>

<p>"Can't Strauss do any better by you than that? Or
maybe you have gone back to collecting again?" I asked.</p>

<p>The Irishman grunted his acknowledgment of my joke,
and we talked about one thing and another, both knowing
perfectly well what there was between us. Finally
he said it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you thought you could do better by sticking with
the old man?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"How long do you think he'll keep goin'?"</p>

<p>"About as long as I stay with him, John."</p>

<p>"And you put him up to buying that junk at the
auction the other day?" he added.</p>

<p>"I bought it for myself," I replied promptly.</p>

<p>"The h&mdash;l you did! Say, kid, this ain't any gospel
game you are in. You needn't look for favors from
our crowd."</p>

<p>"We aren't asking any just now. When we want
them, I guess we'll get all that we need."</p>

<p>"You will, will you?" Big John raised his whip and
hit his horse as if he meant to lay the same lash on me
one of these days. The red-wheeled cart disappeared
down the road, the figure of the burly Irishman leaning
forward and flecking the horse with his lash.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE ATLAS ON THE FLOOR</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>A tell-tale portrait&mdash;When the fire of life has gone&mdash;The guiding
hand&mdash;A woman who understands&mdash;The highroads of commerce&mdash;The
great Southwest&mdash;Dreams&mdash;The art of life&mdash;"No

<p>Mr. Dround's illness kept him away from business
for a mouth or more. He had always been in delicate
health, and this worry over the loss of Carmichael and
the bad outlook in his affairs was too much for him. His
absence gave me the opportunity to form my plans undisturbed
by his timidity and doubts. After he recovered,
his time was much absorbed by the preparations for the
Fair, in which he was much interested. In all this I
could see a deft hand guiding and restraining&mdash;giving
me my rein. At last, when I was ready to lay my plans
before Mr. Dround, I made an appointment with him at
his house.</p>

<p>He was sitting alone in his great library, looking at a
picture which one of the artists attracted to the city by
the Fair was painting of him. When he heard my step
he got up sheepishly and hung a bit of cloth over the portrait,
but not before I had seen the cruel truth the painter
had been telling his patron. For the face on the canvas
was old and gray; the daring and spirit to fight, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>ever
the man had been born with, had gone out of it.
I pitied him as he stood there by his picture, his thin lips
trembling with nervousness. He seemed to shrink from
me as though afraid of something. We sat down, and
after the first words of politeness neither of us spoke.
Finally he asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Harrington, how do you find matters now that
you have had time to look into the situation?"</p>

<p>"Very much as I expected to find them," I replied
bluntly. "And that is as bad as could be. Something
must be done at once, and I have come to you to-day to
settle what that shall be."</p>

<p>He flushed a little proudly at my words, but I plunged
in and sketched the situation to him as it had become
familiar to me. At first he was inclined to interrupt and
question my statements, but he saw that I had my facts.
As I went on, showing him how his big rivals had taken
his markets&mdash;how his business had fallen so that he
could no longer get those special rates he had been too
virtuous to accept&mdash;he seemed to slink into his chair.
It was like an operation; but there was no use in wasting
time in pity. His mind must be opened. Toward the
end he closed his eyes and looked so weak that once I
stopped. But he motioned to me to go on.</p>

<p>"And what do you advise?" he asked weakly at the
end.</p>

<p>"I have already begun to act," I replied with a smile,
and outlined what had been done.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"That has been tried before. All such combinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
have failed. Strauss, or one of the others, will split
it up."</p>

<p>I did not believe that the combination which I had
to propose would be so easily disturbed. In the midst of
our argument some one came into the room behind us and
paused, listening. I stopped.</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" Mr. Dround said, looking up.
"We are talking business."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said slowly. She was in street clothes,
with hat, and she began to draw off her gloves slowly.
"Shall I disturb you?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," he answered indifferently, and I resumed
my argument. Mrs. Dround sat down behind the table
and opened some letters, busying herself there. But I
felt her eyes on my words. Unconsciously I addressed
the rest of my argument to her. When I had finished,
Mr. Dround leaned back wearily in his seat and sighed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yours is a very bold plan, Mr. Harrington. It might
succeed if we could get the necessary financial support.
But, as you know well enough, this is hardly the time to
provide money for any venture. The banks would not
look favorably upon such a speculative suggestion. We
shall have to wait until better times."</p>

<p>"We can't wait," I said brusquely. "Bad times or
not, we must act."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I will think it over. It is time for my
medicine, isn't it, Jane?" he said, looking fretfully at
his wife.</p>

<p>It was a broad hint for me to take myself off, and my
wild schemes with me. For a moment I felt disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
with myself for believing that anything could be accomplished
with this failing reed. Mrs. Dround came softly
up to her husband's chair and leaned over him.</p>

<p>"You are too tired for more business to-day, dear.
Come&mdash;let me get your medicine."</p>

<p>She took his arm and with all the gentleness in the
world led him from the room, motioning to me with one
hand to keep my seat. When they had gone I removed
the cloth from the portrait on the easel and took a good
look at it. It was the picture of a gentleman, surely.
While I was looking at it, and wondering about the man,
Mrs. Dround came back into the room and stood at my side.</p>

<p>"It is good, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted reluctantly, thinking it was only
too good. As I replaced the cloth over the picture, I
noticed that her lips were drawn tight as if she suffered.
I had read a part of their story in that pathetic little way
in which she had led her husband from the room.</p>

<p>"So you have started," she said soon, turning away
from the picture. "How are you getting on? Tell me
everything!"</p>

<p>When she had the situation before her, she remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now is the time to take the next step, and for that
you need Mr. Dround's help."</p>

<p>"Exactly. These separate plants must be taken over,
a holding company incorporated, and the whole financed.
It can be done if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If Mr. Dround will consent," she finished my sentence,
"and give his aid in raising the money?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Her shrewdness, immediate comprehension, roused my
admiration. But what was her interest in the scheme?
As Sarah had told me, it was generally believed that
Jane Dround had a large fortune in her own right.
Why should she bother with the packing business?
She might spend her time more agreeably picking up
Italian marbles. Her next words partly answered my
wonder:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course, he will see this, and will consent; or
prepare to lose everything."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't like to pull out of things," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dround is in such poor health," I objected.</p>

<p>"This is not his fight: it is yours. All that he can
do is to give you your first support. Leave that to me.
Tell me what you will do with this corporation&mdash;what
next?"</p>

<p>She was seated in a little chair, resting her dark head
upon her hands. Her eyes read my face as I spoke.
Again, as the other time when we had spoken in the
garden, I felt as though lifted suddenly on the wings
of a strong will. At a bound my mind swept up to meet
her mind. On the shelf near by there was a large atlas.
I took it down, and placing it on the rug at our feet, turned
the leaves until I came to the plate of the United States.</p>

<p>"Come here. Look there!" I said, indicating the
entire eastern third of the map with a sweep of my
hand. "There is nothing for us that way to be had.
We could never get to the seaboard. The others own
that territory."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The map was streaked with lines of railroad running
like the currents of a great river from the broad prairies
of the Dakotas, across the upper Mississippi Valley,
around the curve of the Great Lakes, eastward to the
Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>"Those are the old highroads," I went on, following
the lines of trade with my finger. "And those are the
old markets. We must find a new territory, make it,
create the roads. And it must be a territory that
is waiting, fertile, unexplored! Here it is!"</p>

<p>My hand ran down the map southwestward, crossing
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Indian Territory, resting
on the broad tract marked Texas.</p>

<p>"For us that will be what the Northwest has
been for our fathers.  There lies the future&mdash;our
future!"</p>

<p>"Our future," she repeated slowly, with pleasure in
the words. "You plan to feed this land?"</p>

<p>"Settlers are pouring in there, now, like vermin. The
railroads are following, and already there are the only
strong markets we have to-day&mdash;those I have been building
up for five years."</p>

<p>We sat there on the floor before the atlas, and the
bigness of the idea got hold of both of us. I pointed
out the great currents of world trade, and plotted a
new current, to rise from that same wheat land of the
Dakotas, flowing southward to the ports of the Gulf.
Already, as I knew, the wheat and corn and meat of this
Western land had begun to turn southward, avoiding the
gate of Chicago with its heavy tolls, to flow by the path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of least resistance out through the ports of the Gulf to
Europe and Asia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i192" id="i192"></a>
<img src="images/i192.jpg" width="390" height="489" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>I pointed out the great currents of world trade.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"This is but the beginning, then&mdash;this packing company?"
she questioned slowly, putting her finger on the
inner truth, as was her wont.</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" I laughed back in the recklessness of
large plans. "The meat business is nothing to what's
coming. We shall have a charter that will let us build
elevators, railroads, own ports, run steamship lines&mdash;everything
that has to do with the handling of food
stuffs. Some day that canal will be dug, and then,
then"....</p>

<p>I can't say how long we were there on our knees
before that atlas.  It may all seem childish, but the
most astonishing thing is that most of what we imagined
then has come true in one way or another. And faster
even than my expectation.</p>

<p>At last we looked up, at the same moment, and our
eyes rested on the portrait above us. The cloth had
slipped from the canvas, and there was the speaking
face, old and saddened&mdash;the face without hope, without
desire. It seemed the face of despair, chiding us for
our thoughts of youth and hope. Mrs. Dround arose
from the floor and hung the cloth in its place, touching
the portrait softly here and there. Then she stood,
resting her hands on the frame, absorbed in thought.
A kind of gloom had come over her features.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this scheme you have plotted, is life! It is
imagination!" She drew a long breath as though to
shake off the lethargy of years. "That art," she pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to the picture of a pale, ghostly woman's face, hanging
near by us on the wall&mdash;"that is a mere plaything
beside yours."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about art: that is the work of
a man's own two hands. But mine is the work of thousands
and thousands, hands and brains. And it can be
ruined by a trick of fate."</p>

<p>"No, never! You shall have your chance&mdash;I promise
it&mdash;I know! Sit down here and let us go back to the
first steps and work it out again carefully."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So there in the fading twilight of the afternoon was
formed the American Meat Products Company. Again
and again we went over the companies to be included,
the sources of credit, the men to interest, the bankers
from whom money might be had.</p>

<p>"It is here we must have Mr. Dround's help," I
pointed out significantly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"When this step is taken, I think he ought to go
abroad&mdash;he needs the rest. He could leave all else to
you, I think."</p>

<p>I understood; the corporation once formed, he would
drop out.</p>

<p>"There might be matters to which he would object&mdash;"</p>

<p>She translated my vague words.</p>

<p>"No one asks, if you <i>succeed</i>," she answered tranquilly.</p>

<p>And with that observation were settled those troublesome
questions of morality which worried Mr. Dround so
deeply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>As I left I said in homage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If this thing is pulled off, it will be <i>yours</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Mr. Dround doesn't like women to meddle
with business. It is all yours, all yours&mdash;and I am
glad to have it so."</p>

<p>Her eyes came back to mine, and she smiled in
dismissal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE STRUGGLE</p>

of finance&mdash;Getting help&mdash;Cousin Farson&mdash;A trip down
the coast&mdash;Paternal admonition&mdash;The beautiful city beside the

<p>It is not my purpose to recall all the details of the
crowded years that followed. From the autumn of '92,
when the events that I have just related occurred,
through the period of deepening depression in all business
and the succeeding era of prosperity, I can do little
more than touch here and there upon more vital events.
Suffice it to say that we were met at the start with hard
times, a period of tight money, which prevented the
quick realization of my plan to incorporate the properties
that had been gathered together. One way and another
the companies were carried along, by issuing notes and
securing what financial help could be got, waiting for
the favorable time to launch our enterprise. Here Mr.
Dround was a strong help: once committed to the undertaking,
he persuaded others and used his credit generously.
Sometimes he looked back, seeking to retreat
from the positions to which he was being forced; but he
saw only ruin behind him, and perforce went ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange to say, we met at first little or no opposition
from our strong rivals. Whether it was that Strauss
and his crowd were willing to let the mice foregather
into one trap before showing their claws, or that they
despised us as weaklings, no one could say. We were
able, even, to join the great packers in one of those private
agreements that made it possible for us to secure our
share of the home trade. Mr. Dround was aware of
this fact, but averted his eyes. Necessity knows little
squeamishness. It must have filled John Carmichael
with unholy joy to know that Dround had come to this
compromise with his virtue.</p>

<p>So, in spite of the hard times, we pushed on, branching
out here and there as the chance offered, building a plant
in Texas, where Will was sent to take charge, and making
a deal with a car line that had been started by some
Boston men. But the time came when we had to have
more money, and have it at once. There was none to
be raised in Chicago, where the frost of the panic had
settled first and hardest. Slocum, who was my right
hand all these months, suggested that the money might
be had from the Boston men who owned the car line. So
in July, '93, we made a hurried trip to the East. They
were frightened in Boston, and we met with little but
disappointment. Men were waiting for Congress to repeal
the silver law, or do something else to make it
pleasant, and wouldn't listen to putting out another
dollar in a Chicago enterprise. Then it occurred to
Slocum that we might interest a man he knew named
Farson, the rich man of his old home, Portland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Farson, we found, was down the coast somewhere on
his vacation, and we followed after him. It was the
first time I had ever been in that part of the country,
and the look of it was queer to me&mdash;a lot of scrawny,
rocky fields and wooden-built towns. When we failed
to find Farson in Portland, it did not seem to me worth
while to go on&mdash;I doubted if there was as much money
in the whole town as we had to have; but Sloco was
strongly of the opinion that these Maine people had
fortunes tucked away in their old stockings. So we
kept on down the coast, and found our man at his summer
cottage, on a little rocky island.</p>

<p>This Mr. Farson was a short, wiry, little man, almost
sixty years old, with a close-cropped gray mustache, and
looked for all the world like a retired school-teacher. He
received us on his front piazza, and it took him and
Slocum half an hour to establish just the degree of
cousinship they were to each other. I wanted to laugh
and to put in: "We've come to make your fortune,
cousin. It don't make any difference whether you are
third once removed or second twice removed." But I
thought it likely that Slocum knew his business best
with these people and kept quiet.</p>

<p>When Slocum got around to saying that we were interested
in various Western enterprises, the weather
seemed to grow cool all of a sudden. But Cousin Farson
listened politely and asked some good questions at the
end. Then he let us go all the way across the harbor
to the hotel where we had put up, to get our dinner. I
thought we had lost him, but Slocum thought not. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Cousin Farson had asked us to go fishing with him in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"He might have given us a sandwich," I growled
to Slocum. "That place of his looks as if he could
afford it."</p>

<p>Slocum smiled at my irritation.</p>

<p>"He did not ask you down here. He doesn't feel responsible
for your coming. Probably Cousin Susan would
need a warning before inviting two strangers to dinner."</p>

<p>Well, the little old schoolmaster came over in the afternoon
with a very pretty steam launch. The fishing was
not all a pretence. He liked to fish; but I never saw a
man who listened as keenly as that man did. And I did
the talking. I let him see that we were engaged on a
big work; that in putting his dollars into our packing-houses
he wasn't just taking a flyer, way off at the end of
the earth. I had had some experience in dealing with
men by this time; it was no raw young schemer who
came to this party. And I had observed that what men
want when they are thinking of putting their money into
a new enterprise is to have confidence in the men who
will spend their dollars. My experience has shown me
that the cheapest thing to get in this world is money.
If you have the ideas, the money will flow like water
downhill. At any rate, that was the way it worked with
good Mr. Farson.</p>

<p>We stayed there in Deer Isle three days, and had
one simple meal in the banker's house after Cousin Susan
had been duly warned. At the end of the time Farson
thought he would give us a couple of hundred thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
dollars and take some of our bonds, and he thought
maybe his brother-in-law would take a few more, and
also his brother-in-law's brother. In short, Mr. Farson
was the first one in a long row of bricks. He went up
with us on the Boston boat, when we started back, to
secure the others. It was a glorious night early in
August, and, after Slocum had gone to bed, the old
banker and I sat up there on the deck watching the coast
fade away in the moonlight. I had never seen anything
like it before in my life&mdash;the black rocks starting right
out of the water, the stiff little fir trees, the steep hills
rolling back from the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i200" id="i200"></a>
<img src="images/i200.jpg" width="450" height="104" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>The black rocks starting right out of the water.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"This is the prettiest thing I have ever seen!" I exclaimed.
"My wife must come down here next summer."</p>

<p>"Yes," the old gentleman replied, with evident pleasure
in my praise of his native rocks. "I can tell you that
there is very little in the world to compare with the charm
of this coast."</p>

<p>Then he began to talk of other lands, and I found that
he had been all over the earth. He talked of Italy, and
India, and Japan, and parts of Russia. After a time he
began to ask me questions about myself, and being an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
easy talker, and happy over the success we had had, I
told him a good deal of my story, and how I had come to
enter the present undertaking. It was easy to tell him
things&mdash;he had quick sympathy and was as keen as a
boy. He seemed to approve of my general plan, but
advised patience.</p>

<p>"This silver trouble will lead to a period of bad times,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"The very time to prepare," I retorted.</p>

<p>"True," he laughed, "when you have the faith and
energy. But I am an old man. I wish to live in peace
the rest of my life. Young man, I have been through
two panics and the war. I lost a son while I was in the
Wilderness. He would have been about your age," he
added, in a far-away tone.</p>

<p>That switched the talk from business, and we sat there
on deck until nearly dawn, discussing religion all the time.
As he bade me good-by at the Boston station the next
evening, I remember his saying to me with one of the
pleasantest smiles I ever saw on a man's face:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Harrington, I can see that yours will be a
busy life. Success will come not merely in these matters,
but in many others." He wagged his head confidently. "I
don't make many mistakes in men. But if you ever want
to have such pleasant talks as we had last night, when
you get to be an old man like me, you must see to it that
your hands are kept clean. Remember that, my boy!"
And he patted my shoulder like a father.</p>

<p>It was a queer thing for one man to say to another at
the end of a business day. I had occasion to think of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
later, although at the time I put it down to the old gentleman's
eccentricity. We parted very cordially. I felt
that a valuable ally had been secured&mdash;one who had it in
his power to bring others with him to our aid,&mdash;and I
liked the old boy himself.</p>

<p>Among other things, Mr. Farson had asked me casually
about a little line of Missouri railroad&mdash;the St. Louis
Great Southern, it was called. He and his friends were
pretty well loaded with the securities of this bankrupt
little road, and the banker wanted me to look into it and
advise him what to do with the property. Thus it happened
that the St. Louis Great Southern became another
link in my plan of conquest. Altogether it was a most
important connection, that between us and Farson's
crowd, and it was fortunate that Slocum thought of
Cousin Farson in our hour of need.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>All this time there had been building the beautiful
city of white palaces on the lake, and it was now open
for the world to see what Chicago had dreamed and
created. Although it had made me impatient to have
Mr. Dround spend on it his energy that was needed in
his own business, now that it was accomplished, in all
its beauty and grandeur, it filled me with admiration.</p>

<p>There were few hours that I could spend in its enjoyment,
but I remember one evening after my return from
the East when we had a family party at the Fair. May
and Will were spending his vacation with us during the
hot weather, and the four of us, having had our dinner,
took an electric launch and glided through the lagoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
beneath the lofty peristyle out to the lake, which was as
quiet as a pond. The long lines of white buildings were
ablaze with countless lights; the music from the bands
scattered over the grounds floated softly out upon the
water; all else was silent and dark. In that lovely hour,
soft and gentle as was ever a summer night, the toil and
trouble of men, the fear that was gripping men's hearts
in the market, fell away from me, and in its place came
Faith. The people who could dream this vision and
make it real, those people from all parts of the land who
thronged here day after day&mdash;their sturdy wills and
strong hearts would rise above failure, would press on
to greater victories than this triumph of beauty&mdash;victories
greater than the world had yet witnessed!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of hopeful thoughts like these,
none knew better than I the skeleton that lay at the
feast, the dread of want and failure that was stealing
over all business. But for that night we were happy
and without fear....</p>

<p>As our launch drew up at the landing beside the great
fountain, another launch glided by our side, holding a
number of the Commissioners and some guests of distinction.
Among them were the Drounds, who had
entertained liberally all this season. The two boat
parties came to shore together, and stood looking at the
display of fireworks. The Court of Honor was thronged
with thousands and thousands; the great fountain rippled
in a blaze of light; the dark peristyle glowed for
a moment in the fantastic flame from the fireworks.
I turned and caught the light of the illumination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
in the dark face of Jane Dround. She bowed and
smiled.</p>

<p>"In your honor!" she murmured half mockingly, as a
rocket burst into a shower of fiery spray in the heavens
above. "I hear that you return from Boston victor.
You should hear Henry! He has no doubts now." She
laughed in high spirits, and we stood there awhile
gazing.</p>

<p>"To-night I have no doubts; but to-morrow&mdash;who
knows?"</p>

<p>Her brows contracted seriously.</p>

<p>"You need, my friend, one great quality, and you must
get it somehow&mdash;patience!"</p>

<p>"That is true, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Patience!" she repeated slowly; "the patience that
covers years. Perhaps you think that is a woman's
virtue, but men, too, must have it if they are to endure.
Remember&mdash;patience! Now, before any one comes, let
me tell you: we are to leave for Europe as soon as the
Fair closes. Do you think that it will be all right by
that time? Say yes or no," she added, as we were
approached by May and Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered with a strange feeling of sadness.</p>

<p>Once more, before we left the grounds, I caught a
moment of talk with Mrs. Dround.</p>

<p>"To you the game&mdash;the great game!" she exclaimed
softly. "And to me the waiting. But remember, one
useless woman is watching across the water every move
you make, and when the time comes that you want help,
when you cannot go on alone&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i205" id="i205"></a>

</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>It sounded like woman's sentiment, and I interrupted
jokingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I am in the last ditch, cable you?"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me! I am more earnest than you
know. If that time comes&mdash;if you don't know which
way to turn for help, if you have done <i>all</i>, and still&mdash;"</p>

<p>We were standing beside a bandstand, and at that
moment the music crashed out, flooding us with deafening
sound.</p>

<p>She pressed my hand, smiled, and turned away. I
thought no more of her words then. But some weeks
later, before the Drounds sailed for Europe, there came
in my mail an envelope addressed in a woman's hand.
Inside there was only another envelope, marked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the last ditch!"</p>

<p>I tossed it into a drawer, rather annoyed by the silliness
of it all. It was the first evidence of weakness I
had ever detected in this intelligent woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah and I were sitting over our coffee one morning,
six months after the Fair had closed its gates for the

<p>It seemed strange that she should ask such a question
in a simple, childish way. But she had been shut away
from people and things of late, and it was not her nature
to explore what was not right in her path.</p>

<p>"A panic," I replied, finishing my coffee, "is hell!
Now I must run and see what has happened to us."</p>

<p>She looked at me in round-mouthed astonishment, and
when I bent over to kiss her good-by, she said reprovingly:</p>

<p>"You don't mean it could touch us, Van?"</p>

<p>"It might," I smiled, thinking of the troubled waters
where I was swimming.</p>

<p>"We must trust Providence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And me."</p>

<p>"Van!" she kissed me with a bit of reproof. "I wish
you would be more religious."</p>

<p>My wife had been growing very serious of late. Under
May's example she had taken to church work and attended
religious classes. She and May had discovered
lately a new preacher, who seemed a very earnest young
man. The Bible class he had formed sometimes met at
our house, and Sarah preferred to go to his church, which
was a long way from our house, to the church near by
where we had a pew. It made little difference where I
was taken to church, and I was glad to have Sarah
pleased with her young preacher. So I kissed my wife
good-by and hurried off, half an hour late as it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>There was trouble brewing. It had shown a hand
some months back, darkly and mysteriously. One day,
while I was East, a man had walked into Slocum's office,
introduced himself as a Henry A. Frost, and said that he
represented some minority bondholders of the defunct
London and Chicago Company. We knew that there
were a few scattered bonds outstanding, not more than
forty thousand dollars all told, but we had never looked for
trouble from them. Mr. Frost represented to Slocum that
his "syndicate" did not wish to make us trouble, but that
before the property of the London and Chicago concern
was finally turned over to our corporation he wished to
effect a settlement. Slocum asked him his figure for
the bonds held by his "syndicate," believing at the worst
that Frost would demand little more than the cash price
of fifty. To his astonishment the man wanted par and
interest, and when Slocum laughed at his proposal, he
threw out hints of trouble that might come if his
"syndicate" were not satisfied.</p>

<p>Slocum referred the matter to me, and advised me to
seek some compromise with Frost. "For," he said, "our
record is not altogether clear in that transaction," referring
to the sum we had paid for services to the treasurer
of the bankrupt corporation. This move on the part of
Frost and his associates was blackmail, of course, but the
lawyer advised compromise. It would have been the
wise thing to do; but having succeeded so far, I felt my
oats too much to be held up in this fashion. I refused
peremptorily to deal with the man, and Slocum intimated
to him, when he called for a reply, that we would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
consider giving him more than the other bondholders had
received; namely, fifty per cent of the par value of the
bonds he held in new bonds. Frost went off, and we
had heard nothing more from him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had gone our way, making ready to turn
over our properties, rounding up this matter and that,
guarding against the tight money market, and quietly
getting things in order for putting out our securities.
Then one day had come, like a thunderbolt from an
open sky, an injunction, restraining the American Meat
Products Company from taking over the properties of the
London and Chicago Company, the petitioners alleging
that they held bonds of the latter concern, and that the
sale of its properties to the representatives of the American
Meat Products Company had been tainted with fraud.
A Judge Garretson, of the Circuit Court, had granted the
temporary injunction one night at his house, and the
argument for the permanent decree was set for April 10,
a fortnight later. The names of the petitioners, all but
Frost's, were unknown to us.</p>

<p>"There is the trail of the snake!" Slocum muttered
when he had read the injunction. "We had better find
Lokes. This will be in the papers to-night, and in the
Eastern papers to-morrow morning&mdash;you will hear from
it all over."</p>

<p>Sure enough, the next noon I had a telegram from
Farson in Boston:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papers print injunction A.M.P. Co.; charge fraud.
Wire explanation."</p>

<p>"Cousin John didn't let the grass grow under him,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Slocum grimly remarked when I handed him this telegram
at luncheon. "You had better let me answer him.
Now for Lokes: he denies all knowledge, and it's plain
enough that he isn't interested in having this matter
aired. But some one must have found out pretty accurately
what has happened. Perhaps Lokes when he was
drunk let out what he had got from us. Anyhow, it's
blackmail, and the question is what are we going to do
about it. It will cost us a pretty penny to settle now!"</p>

<p>The situation was alarming. Unless we could get that
injunction dissolved, and speedily, our project faced
serious danger. The banker Farson's telegram was only
the first. The banks and our backers East and West
would soon call us to account.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> blackmail," I said to Slocum, "and if there is a
way out we will not pay those rats. Find out what you
can about them."</p>

<p>In a day or two he came over to me with the information
he had obtained. The "syndicate" consisted of
three or four cheap fellows, hangers-on of a broker's office.
One of them happened to be a relative of Judge Garretson,
who had issued the midnight injunction.</p>

<p>"I got that last from Ed Hostetter," Slocum explained.
"I met him on the street as I was coming over here.
Having heard that this Lucas Smith lived out Ed's way,
in May Park, I asked him if he knew anything about the
man. He said at once: 'You mean the jedge's brother-in-law?
He's a political feller.' Of course this Smith
is a bum like the rest."</p>

<p>So we had in Ed, who had come back to work for me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
having failed in a market where I had started him after
the sausage plant was sold.</p>

<p>"Ed," I said to him, "we want you to find out all you
can about this brother-in-law of Judge Garretson's. See
if you can learn how many of those London and Chicago
bonds he holds."</p>

<p>The next morning Ed brought us the information that
Lucas Smith was willing enough to talk, boasting that
he and his friends were going "to tune up those packers
in good style." Ed thought they had got their tip from
one of Lokes's pals. It seems that Smith owned, nominally,
only two of the bonds. And there we were!
Slocum rubbed his chin, trying to see light in a dark
place.</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is this Judge Garretson?" I
asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Good enough for a political judge, I guess. He's up
for reëlection this fall. There was some talk about his
attitude in traction cases, but nothing positive against
him."</p>

<p>"See here, Ed!"&mdash;I turned to Hostetter abruptly&mdash;"I
want you to go straight out to this Lucas Smith's
place and find him. Tell him you know where he can
get twenty-five thousand dollars for those two bonds of
his the day Judge Garretson dissolves that injunction."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Van!" Slocum interposed. "That is too
strong! I stuck by you last time, but I won't stand for
this!"</p>

<p>"Go on, Ed!" I called out to Hostetter peremptorily.
"Tell him just that&mdash;the day the injunction is dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>solved
he gets twenty-five thousand dollars for his bonds,
and the other rats don't get a cent!"</p>

<p>Slocum rose without a word and put on his hat. I put
my hand on his shoulder and pushed him back into his
chair.</p>

<p>"You aren't going to quit like that, Sloco, after all
these years! Think it over. What else is there for us
to do? Can we have this business aired in court?
What will Farson say to that story of Lokes's? Do you
think we could buy the bonds from those <i>rats</i> for any
likely figure?&mdash;for any figure, if Carmichael is waiting
around the corner to pick up our cake when we are forced
to drop it?"</p>

<p>He sank into the chair rather limp, and we looked at
each other for a minute or two.</p>

<p>"Well," he said slowly, "it might as well come out
now as later."</p>

<p>"You have got to sit in the boat with me, Sloco! I
need you." I leaned across the table and looked into his
eyes. Slowly, after a time, he nodded, and gave himself
up to me to do my will. In the heat of my trouble, I
scarce realized what that acquiescence cost him: he
never gave another sign. But it cost him, one way
and another, more than I ever could repay,&mdash;and now
I know it.</p>

<p>We walked out together, and as I turned in the
direction of home I said cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once out of this mess, old man, we shall be on easy
street, and you can buy a block of those old brick shanties
back in Portland!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The lawyer smiled at my speech, but turned away
without another word.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Judge Garretson dissolved the injunction in due course.
What is more, he roasted the petitioning parties who
had entered his court "with flimsy and fraudulent pretexts."
There was a righteous flavor to his eloquence
that would have been worthy of a better cause. Nevertheless,
that same evening Lucas Smith collected his
price from Ed and delivered his bonds.</p>

<p>I turned to Slocum, who was with me in court when
the decision was handed down, and said jubilantly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That worked. They can't touch us now! I guess
we've seen the end of this business."</p>

<p>Slocum demurred still.</p>

<p>"Maybe, but I doubt it. You don't think that Frost
and his pals are going to sit quiet after such a roast?
They will nose around to find out who sold them out."</p>

<p>But I did not pay much heed to the lawyer's fears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE STRIKE</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The labor question from the inside&mdash;A talk with strikers&mdash;Tit
for tat all round&mdash;A ticklish place for an argument&mdash;My anarchist&mdash;Bluff&mdash;It
works&mdash;We call it square</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Meantime, for a little entertainment, we had a strike
in one of our Indiana plants. At first it didn't make
much difference: all the packers had been shutting down
here and there during the cold months, and we were
ready to close that particular plant.</p>

<p>But as the severe winter of '94 passed, and the men
saw that we were in no hurry to start work until better
times, they began to get ugly, to set fire to the buildings,
and do other injuries. There was no police protection
to amount to anything in any of these country
places, and it would cost too much to keep a sufficient
force of hired detectives to guard the property.</p>

<p>It got on toward spring and we wanted to open the
place for a short run, but I was determined not to give
in to the union, especially since they had taken to hurting
the property. There had been a number of strikes
that year, notably the great one at Pullman, followed by
the railroad trouble. It was a most senseless time for
any man with a job to quit work, and the employers were
feeling pretty set about not giving in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember that about this time some of the preachers
in the city, and among them the Reverend Mr. Hardman,
Sarah's young man, got loose on the strike question and
preached sermons that were printed in the newspapers.
Hardman's ideas were called "Christian Socialism," and
it all sounded pretty, but wouldn't work twenty-four
hours in Chicago. I wanted Sarah to try a new minister,
who had sense enough to stick to his Bible, but she was
loyal to Hardman, and even thought there might be something
in his ideas.</p>

<p>Well, it got along into July, and I concluded to run
down to our Indiana plant and see what could be done
with the situation. There was a committee of the union
waiting for me in the superintendent's office. We talked
back and forth a considerable time, and finally I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, boys, I want you to come over the plant
with me and let me show you what some of you strikers
have done, and what it will cost us before we can open
up."</p>

<p>So I tramped over the place with the men, and I pointed
out damages to the property that would cost the company
over ten thousand dollars to repair.</p>

<p>"Now, go home and ask your union if they will stand
for that bill?"</p>

<p>They thought it was my little joke. They could not
understand that a union, if it is to have the power to
force a rise in wages, must be responsible also for the
damage done by its members. Nor could they see that
if the company wasn't making money, they could not
make more money out of the company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, after talking with the lot of obstinate Poles
for three hours, I turned them all away, with the suggestion
that they might see a trainload of men coming in
from the South in about a week if they didn't come back&mdash;for
we were going to open on the first of the month.
They trotted off to a saloon to talk it over. The superintendent
shook his head and talked about a riot if we
should try getting in new men. Then he and I went
over the place together to see about improvements, and
spent another hour looking into every corner of the
building.</p>

<p>He left me up in the loft of the main building, while
he went back for some plans that were in the office.
I poked about here and there in the dusty, cobwebbed
place. There was only rough scantling for a floor, and
below my feet I could see the gaping mouths of the great
vats, still filled with dirty, slimy water. Pretty soon I
heard the tread of feet coming up the stairs. It didn't
sound like the superintendent. He was a light man, and
this was a heavy person. I called out to the man to take
care, as the light was none too good, and a tumble to the
floor below into one of those vats would be no joke.
He did not reply, and I was bending over looking down
between the boards and trying to make out who it was,
when suddenly I felt myself grasped by the neck. I
straightened up, and both of us came near tumbling over
backward through the loose boarding.</p>

<p>"Quit your fooling!" I cried, wondering what had got
into the fellow.</p>

<p>Then I threw him off a bit and could see that I had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
do with one of those men who had been talking with me
down below in the office.</p>

<p>"So you get some other help, you do, you do?" he
began to spit at me. "I know you! I know you!"</p>

<p>There was very little light in that loft, for the day was
pretty well over. All that could be seen by me was a
stocky, short man, with a face covered by a heavy beard.
I remembered that I had seen him in the office with the
other men, though he had not done any talking.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "what are <i>you</i> after, John?"</p>

<p>Considering my position, I thought it was as well to
speak good-naturedly. It wasn't just the place for a
wrestling match.</p>

<p>"I know you!" He came forward again and shook
his fist in my face. "You are one of the men who murdered
my friends. Yes, you did murder them!"</p>

<p>"You're drunk, John," I said as coolly as I could.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do know. Seven, eight year ago. At the
trial!"</p>

<p>"So you are an anarchist! Those were your friends,
were they?"</p>

<p>"And this time yust look out for yourself!"</p>

<p>He made a grab for me, and I jumped out of his reach.
In doing so, I slipped on one of the boards, and went
through part way. In the distance below me I could see
those tough-looking vats.</p>

<p>It was only a question now of how soon the superintendent
would come. I could not hear the sound of his
steps below. Perhaps my anarchist had settled him
first. In that case there was little help for me. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
should struggle, he could kick me over the edge as easily
as you could brush off a fly from the side of a bowl. So,
to gain time, I thought I would try to make the man talk.
Then, at the last, I could grab
him by the legs and fight it
out in that way, or pull him
down with me.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>He undertook to give me a
lesson then and there on
the rights of the anarchist.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"So you think you'll get
even by killing me! What is
the good of that? You'll be
caught the first thing, and you
and your mates won't
get one cent more for
your day's work than
you've had before. I
don't count for so much.
Some one else will take my
place in this business, and you
will have the same trick to
play over again. He will boss
you, and you will work for
him."</p>

<p>My theory of life seemed to
amuse my earnest friend, for
he undertook to give me a lesson then and there on the
rights of the anarchist.</p>

<p>"Maybe all the others like you will get killed some
day," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, John," I answered. "But you'll never kill
us all. That's one sure thing. And if by any luck you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
should do away with all my kind, your own men would
take to robbing you on a big scale as they do now on a
small one. Here, give me your hand and help me out."</p>

<p>Very likely his answer to my bluff would be my end.
But I was tired out, holding my two hundred pounds
there in the air with my elbows. Strangely enough,
while I watched him, waiting for him to act, and expecting
the last blow, I did not seem to care half as much as
I should have expected to. I thought of Sarah and the
children; I hated to leave the job I had set myself half-done,
with a lot of loose ends for other folks to bungle
over; and it didn't look inviting down there below. But
the fall alone would probably do for me at once, and, personally,
my life didn't seem to be of much consequence.</p>

<p>But my anarchist friend made no move. It seemed to
trouble him, the way I took his attack. So I gave a great
heave, raised myself half up to the girder where he stood,
and held out my hand.</p>

<p>He took it! A moment more I found myself standing
upright beside my anarchist. The next thing was to induce
him to continue the discussion a few floors lower
down, where there would be less likelihood of losing our
balance in the course of a heated argument. But I sat
down, friendly-like, on one of the cross-beams, and began
to talk.</p>

<p>"So you are an anarchist? Yes, I helped to hang your
friends. I had some doubts about the matter then. But
just here, now, after my experience with you, I haven't
any at all."</p>

<p>I gave him a good sermon&mdash;the gospel of man against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
man, as I knew it, as I had learned it in my struggles for
fortune. I showed him how I was more bound than he,&mdash;bound
hand and foot, for he could run away, and I
couldn't. At bottom he wasn't a bad sort of fellow, only
easily excited and loose-minded. In conclusion I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now we'll just step down. I am going home to get
some supper."</p>

<p>I started, and he followed on meekly after me. It
was a rather creepy feeling I had, going over those
stairs! They were perfectly dark by this time, and steep.</p>

<p>"You'll try to fix me for this?" the fellow said, when
we reached the first floor, and I had started toward the
office.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll call this square," I replied, "and forget
it. Good night."</p>

<p>He made a line for the gate, and that was the last I
ever saw of him. I found the superintendent locked in
the office. He had been spending his time telephoning
to the nearest town for help.</p>

<p>Then I took the train for Chicago. That experience
was the greatest bracer I had ever had in my life. Hanging
there with the expectation every minute of dropping
into the vats below had steadied my nerves for a good
long haul. And I needed it, too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">DENOUNCED</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The snake lifts its head&mdash;My picture gets into the newspaper&mdash;The
Reverend Mr. Hardman in his church&mdash;The opinions of
ministers&mdash;Mr. Hardman points his finger at me&mdash;I reply&mdash;A
scene&mdash;The real blow&mdash;May has her say&mdash;Women, religion,
and this earth</i></p></blockquote>


<p>It was the Saturday after my little adventure in
Indiana. As I was riding downtown in a street car, my
eye was caught by a coarse cut in the newspaper that
the man opposite me was reading. The picture seemed
in a general way familiar. Underneath it ran these flaring
head-lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cen pt">BRIBERY OF A JUDGE!</p>

<p class="cen">OFFICIAL IN PACKING CONCERN IMPLICATED!</p>

<p class="cen pb">EXCLUSIVE STORY IN THE <i>NATIONALIST</i>!</p>

<p>I bought a copy of the paper, and when I reached my
office I read the article. It was sprung, plainly enough,
to hit Garretson, who was up for reelection, and, in the
main, they had a straight story,&mdash;Lokes, Frost, the
judge's brother-in-law, and all. And the right figures,
too! The reference to Slocum and me was vague, and
Ed was left out altogether. My picture was put in alongside
of the judge's and labelled "Vice-President and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
General Manager of the American Meat Products Company."
The inference was plain, and the paper wouldn't
have dared to go so far, I judged, if they hadn't their facts
where they could produce them. There was no word of
the story in the other morning papers. I folded up the
article and put it away in my desk, then telegraphed
Slocum, who had gone to St. Louis on some railroad business
for Farson and me.</p>

<p>Luckily, the <i>Nationalist</i> was not a sheet that ever
found its way into my house, but that evening I looked
apprehensively at Sarah. She was pale and quiet,&mdash;she
had been downtown all day shopping,&mdash;but she said
nothing to indicate that she was specially disturbed. The
next day was Sunday, and though Mr. Hardman's preaching
was not much to my liking, I drove over with Sarah
to the little church on the North Side where he held
forth. There was a pretty large congregation that morning,
mostly women and poor people of the neighborhood,
with a few North Side men whom I knew in a business
way.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Hardman never preached a good
sermon that he had written out beforehand. He was
one of those Episcopal preachers who come out in front
of the chancel rail, cross their hands, look down on the
floor, and meditate a few minutes to get their ideas in
flow. Then they raise their eyes in a truly soulful manner
and begin. But to-day, for some reason, Mr. Hardman
didn't go through his trick. He marched out as if
he had something on his mind to get rid of quick, and
shot out his text:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>What shall it profit a man if he gain all and lose his
own soul?</i>"</p>

<p>Then he began talking very distinctly, pausing every
now and then after he had delivered a sentence. He said
that we had fallen on evil days; that corruption was
abroad in the land, polluting the springs of our national
life. And the law breakers came and went boldly in our
midst, the rich and powerful, the most envied and socially
respected. Every one knows the style of his remarks
from that introduction. Most preachers nowadays feel
that they must say this sort of thing once or twice a
year, or their people won't believe they read the papers.
So long as he kept out in the open I had no objection
to his volleys. I had heard it all before, and in the
main I agreed with him&mdash;only he saw but a little way
into the truth.</p>

<p>Suddenly his right arm, which had been hanging
limp by his side, shot out, and as we were sitting pretty
well up front on the main aisle it <i>seemed</i> to point at
us. Sarah gave a little start, and her cheeks flushed
red.</p>

<p>"And I say," the minister thundered, "that when such
men come into our churches, when they have the effrontery
to mingle with God-fearing people, and, unrepentant
of their crimes, desecrate this sanctuary, yea, partake of
the Holy Body, I say it is worse for them than if they
were mere common thieves and robbers! I tell you, my
people, that here in our very midst one of them comes&mdash;a
man who has defied the laws of man and God, the most
sacred; who has corrupted the source of justice; who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
has bought that which the law denied him! This man
has used...."</p>

<p>I had been getting angry, and was looking the minister
in the eye pretty fiercely. At that moment Sarah gave a
little groan. She was very white.</p>

<p>"Come!" I whispered to her, getting up. "Come.
It's time you got out of this."</p>

<p>At first she shook her head, but as I refused to sit
down she rose to follow me. I had stepped to the aisle
and turned to give Sarah my arm when she fainted&mdash;just
sank down with a groan in my arms.</p>

<p>"So this is the gospel you preach!" I called out to
the minister, who had paused and now stepped forward
to help me raise Sarah. "Let her alone! You have hit
her hard enough already. Another time when you undertake
this kind of business, you had better know what you
are talking about."</p>

<p>He stepped back to his desk and kept silent, while I
and one of the ushers who had come forward to help me
lifted Sarah and carried her to the door. When we got
to the end of the aisle Sarah opened her eyes and stood up.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of <i>your</i> gospel, my friend!" I
called back. "I am going where I shall hear religion
and not newspaper scandal."</p>

<p>Sarah groaned and pulled gently at my arm. Once
in the carriage, she turned her face to the window and
looked out as if she were still shocked and sick. I tried
to say something to comfort, but I could only think of
curses for that meddlesome Pharisee, who thought it was
his duty to judge his flock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk about it!" Sarah exclaimed, as if my
words gave her pain.</p>

<p>So we rode home in silence all the way. At the end
she turned to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Just say it isn't true, Van!"</p>

<p>I began to say a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>"No, just say it isn't true!" she interrupted. "I
can't understand all that you are saying. Just say that
you haven't done anything wrong. That's all I want."</p>

<p>"Some people would think it was wrong, Sarah," I
had to say after a while.</p>

<p>She gave a little groan and shut her lips tight. When
we entered the house May was there, with her children.</p>

<p>"Why, my land!" she exclaimed on seeing us.
"What brings you people back so soon? Sarah looks
sick!"</p>

<p>Sarah was ready to faint again. May helped her
up to her room, and I went into my study. Pretty soon
May came down to me.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Sarah, Van?" she asked
sharply. "She seems all queer and out of her head."</p>

<p>Then I told her what had happened.</p>

<p>"Did you see the piece in the paper?" I asked at the
end.</p>

<p>May shook her head. "But I shouldn't wonder if
Sarah had seen it."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, she seemed troubled about something yesterday
when she came into the house after she had been
downtown shopping. She asked me whether I generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
believed the things I saw in the papers. I asked her
what kind of things, and she said,&mdash;'Scandals about
people in business.' I thought it was queer at the
time."</p>

<p>"She won't talk to me about it," I said.</p>

<p>May didn't make any reply to this, and we sat there
some time without talking. Then May asked in a queer
little voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, Van, is there anything in that story? Is it
true in the least way?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you just how it was," I answered.</p>

<p>May was not the kind of person that could be put off
with a general answer, and I was glad to give her the
inside story. So I told her the circumstances of the
case. "It was blackmail and robbery&mdash;the judge was
waiting to be bought. These rats stood between us
and what we had a perfect right to do. There's hardly
a business man in this city who, under the circumstances,
would not have done what we did!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe that!" May exclaimed in her sharp,
decisive little way.</p>

<p>She sat looking at me rather sternly with the same
look on her face that I had remembered for twenty
years. And the next thing that she said was pretty
much what I thought she was going to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Van, you are always a great hand to think what you
want to believe is the only thing to believe! You know
that!"</p>

<p>She smiled unconsciously, with the little ironical
ripple which I knew so well, and I smiled, too. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
couldn't help myself. We both seemed to have gone
back to the old boy and girl days. But I was angry, as
well, and began to defend myself.</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted. "It isn't a mite of use for
you to bluster and get angry, Van. I don't trust you!
I haven't for some time. I have been worried for Will.
Don't you let him mix himself up in your ways of doing
things, Van Harrington!"</p>

<p>"If he is so terribly precious," I said hotly, "I guess
you had better take him back to Jasonville."</p>

<p>"Maybe I shall," she answered quietly. "I'd take
him to the meanest little place in creation rather than
know he had done any such thing as you say you have
done!"</p>

<p>We were both pretty angry by this time, and yet we
both smiled. She was such a snappy, strong little
woman&mdash;I admired her all the time she was making
me angry! Somehow it brought back all that time long
ago when I had thought the world began and ended
with her. We had never been so near each other since.
And I think she felt somewhat in the same way.</p>

<p>"Well," I said at last, "I am not going to fight this
thing out with you, May, or with any other woman.
I have too much else on hand. I am answerable for all
I do or have done. If you and Will don't like my
company, why, we have got to do without you."</p>

<p>I wished I hadn't been so small as to make that fling.
She flashed a look at me out of her eyes that brought
me to my senses in a moment. I took her by the
shoulders. "See here, May, we mustn't quarrel. Let's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
all hang together in this, as in other things. You women
don't know what business means."</p>

<p>She smiled back into my eyes and retorted, "It
seems to be just as well we don't!" In a moment more
she added: "But you mustn't think that I can make up
like this. You and I don't look at things in the same way."</p>

<p>"Never did!" I said dryly. "At any rate, you had
better go up now and look after Sarah. She can't keep
on this way. She's got to look at this more sensibly.
She isn't like you, May!"</p>

<p>"No," May retorted, "she isn't! But this hurts her,
too. Perhaps she cares more what folks <i>say</i> than I do.
And she believes in her religion, Van."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Her religion tells her to forgive,
and not to judge, and a few other sensible truths, which
that minister seemed to forget to-day."</p>

<p>"I never expected to see you, Van Harrington, asking
for quarter in that way!" she flashed.</p>

<p>Then she went back to Sarah. What my sister-in-law
said set me to thinking queer thoughts. I admired the
way she took the matter, though it made me pretty angry
at the time. It seemed straight and courageous, like her.
If we had married, down there at home in the years past,
there would have been some pretty lively times between
us. I could never have got her to look at things my way,
and I don't see how I could have come to see things her
way. For in spite of all the preacher and May had to
say, my feeling was unchanged: women and clergy, they
were both alike, made for some other kind of earth than
this. I was made for just this earth, good and bad as
it is,&mdash;and I must go my way to my end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">TREACHERY</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Who was the traitor?&mdash;Slocum's logic&mdash;We send for our accomplice&mdash;One
look is enough&mdash;The poison of envy&mdash;I see the last
of an old friend&mdash;Slocum points the moral&mdash;What people know&mdash;Public
opinion&mdash;Cousin Farson again&mdash;We lunch at a
depot restaurant&mdash;I touch granite</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The Monday morning after Mr. Hardman's outbreak,
Slocum was waiting for me at my office. In reply to
my telegram he had come back from St. Louis, where
he had been attending to some business in connection
with Farson's railroad.</p>

<p>"They got it pretty straight this time," was all he said
as a greeting, with a care-worn sort of smile.</p>

<p>"They can't prove it! We'll bring suit for libel. I
must put myself straight&mdash;for family reasons."</p>

<p>But the lawyer shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be safe, Van! It's too close a guess.
I rather think they've got all the proof they want."</p>

<p>"Where did they get it, then? Not out of Lokes.
He hasn't any reason to squeal. Nor the judge, nor
his brother-in-law!"</p>

<p>"Of course not; but how about Frost? This is the
way I figure it out: when those rats were euchred in
their hold-up game by Garretson's dismissing his injunc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>tion,
they were mad enough and determined to find
out who sold them. It didn't take them long to see
that the judge had been fixed in some way. They
nosed around, and spotted the judge's brother-in-law
as the one who made the trade. Then they started
out to get proof."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Slocum looked at me shrewdly.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about that all the way back
from St. Louis. There is only one man left in the combination."</p>

<p>We stared at each other for a minute.</p>

<p>"You don't mean <i>him</i>!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Who else?"</p>

<p>"Not Hostetter&mdash;not Ed!"</p>

<p>"Send for him, and we'll find out," he answered
shortly.</p>

<p>I telephoned out to our office in the Yards to send
Hostetter to the city, and while we waited we discussed
the story in all its bearings.</p>

<p>"We've got the trick," Slocum commented in reply to
my desire for action. "And Marx, who managed this
business for Carmichael, is shrewd enough to see it.
<i>They</i> won't bother us."</p>

<p>There was some comfort in that reflection: no matter
what the scandal might be, we had the London and
Chicago properties in our possession, and nothing short
of a long fight in court could wrest them from our control.</p>

<p>"The only thing to do," the lawyer continued, "is to
keep quiet. The papers will bark while the election is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
on, and it looks mighty bad for Garretson. But out
here most people forget easily."</p>

<p>It was queer to hear old Slocum talking in that cynical
tone, as if, having accepted the side that was not to
his taste, he took pleasure in pointing out its safety.</p>

<p>"Well," I grumbled, thinking of May and Sarah, "it's
mighty uncomfortable to be held up by rats like Lokes,
Frost, and company, and then be branded as a briber!"</p>

<p>"What do you care?" Slocum asked harshly. "It
won't hurt <i>you</i> much. You'll make money just the
same, and there aren't many who would lay this up against
you. Of course, there are always a few who are shrewd
enough to guess just about what has happened, and
remember,&mdash;yes, remember a story for years! But you
don't care for their opinion!"</p>

<p>I knew that he was thinking of the honest men in his
own profession, the honorable men at the head of the
bar, who would mark him henceforth as my hired man.</p>

<p>Hostetter arrived soon, a shifty look in his eyes.
He had changed a good deal since that time he had slept
out on the lake front. He was a heavy man, now, with
a fleshy face, and his dress showed a queer love for loud
finery. He wore a heavy seal ring, and a paste diamond
in his tie, which was none too clean. His sandy mustache
dropped tight over his mouth. Yet in spite of his dress
and his jewellery, he was plainly enough the countryman
still.</p>

<p>"Ed," I said at once, "have you been talking to any
one about that matter of the bonds&mdash;the deal with
Lucas Smith?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced at Slocum and then at me. One look at
his face was enough: the story was there.</p>

<p>"You low dog!" I broke out.</p>

<p>Slocum tried to hush me. Hostetter muttered something
about not knowing what we were talking about.</p>

<p>"You're lying, Ed! Tell me the whole truth. Did
you sell what you knew to the <i>Nationalist</i>, or to Frost
and his crowd?"</p>

<p>He became stubborn all at once, and refused to answer.
I turned to the lawyer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"See that man! I picked him out of the bankruptcy
court two years ago, after giving him his third start in
business. Last winter I sent his wife South and kept
her there six months so that she could get well."</p>

<p>I turned to Ed.</p>

<p>"Whose bread are you eating now, to-day?"</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and started for the door. But
I called him back. It came over me all at once what we
had been through together, and I couldn't let him leave
that way, sneak out of my sight for good and all.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Ed," I asked, more miserable than he, "are
you going over to Carmichael to get some more pay for
this?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, if I did," he replied sullenly, "it'd be some
better than it is working for you."</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;not long. Folks like you aren't
worth much. Come, Ed! Did I ever do a mean thing
to you? Didn't I give fifteen cents when we hadn't but
twenty between us? What were you thinking when
you did this dirty piece of business? Just tell me you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
were drunk when you did it. I would have given you
ten times as much as you ever got from them to know
you couldn't do it!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i234" id="i234"></a>
<img src="images/i234.jpg" width="450" height="331" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>You have done something the taste of which will never get out of
your mouth.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>Then he began to go to pieces and cry, and he told me
all I wanted to know. It was a plain case of the poison
of envy. I was rich and on top, and he was working for
thirty dollars a week for me. His wife, who had always
kept a grudge against me for not making up to her in the
old days, had taunted him for taking his wages from me.
She kept telling him that I did nothing for him, and
when she found out about his dealing with Lucas Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
for me, she saw her chance. Somehow Frost got on his
track, and evidently they thought his information was
worth paying something for. That was the whole story.</p>

<p>While we were talking, Slocum slipped out of the room.
It was a pitiful scene.</p>

<p>"Ed," I said finally, "you must go back to the country.
That is the only place for you. You'll grow worse
in the city the longer you stay. Your belly's got bigger
than your brain, and your heart is tainted at the core.
I will start you on a ranch I've got in Texas. Think it
over and get out of this place as soon as you can. I'm
sorry for you, Ed. For you have done something the
taste of which will never get out of your mouth."</p>

<p>He left my office without a word, and that was the last
I ever saw of him. When he had gone Slocum came
back and sat down.</p>

<p>"It was a pretty tough thing for Ed to do," he remarked
calmly, looking out into the muddy street, where
men were hurrying along the pavements. I made no
remark, and he added in the same far-off tone of voice:
"That's the worst of any piece of crooked business: it
breaks up the man you work with. Ed is a rascal now&mdash;and
he was never that before!"</p>

<p>"That's true enough," I assented gloomily.</p>

<p>Slocum advised me to leave the city for a while,
because should the <i>Nationalist</i> charges be investigated
by the Grand Jury, it might be awkward for me. But
I refused to leave the city: no matter what happened,
I was not the man to run and hide. The Democratic
papers made all they could out of the affair, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
after the election it died away. Garretson was reëlected,
and that was a kind of vindication for him.</p>

<p>But the insiders in the city knew that something had
been wrong, and, as Slocum said, the scandal connected
with quashing that injunction followed us for many
years. It was of less importance to me than to Slocum;
for the men with whom I dealt were used to stories like
mine. They believed what they had a mind to, and did
business. But for Slocum it was more serious.</p>

<p>The worst of it for me was at home. Sarah brooded
over the newspaper talk until she was morbid, refusing
to go almost anywhere she would be likely to meet
people she knew. The Bible classes had been given up,
and, naturally enough, we never went back to Mr. Hardman's
church, nor returned to our old church. Sarah and
I talked about it once or twice, but we got nowhere.</p>

<p>"I should think you would care for the children!"
she would cry, persisting in considering me as a criminal.</p>

<p>"You'll see that it won't make the smallest difference to
any one a year hence, if you'll only hold up your head!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't understand business, but May thinks it
pretty bad, I know, because she doesn't come to the house
any more when you are at home."</p>

<p>"She has no reason to act that way. And I don't
mean to have you or May or any other woman holding
me up with your notions of what's right and wrong, just
because the newspapers make a lot of talk."</p>

<p>That ended the matter between us; but for a long
time Sarah avoided our old friends, and the house was
unusually quiet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>What troubled me more than the racket in Chicago
was the way that Dround and Farson and a few other of
our backers might take the story. The Drounds were in
Egypt, but they would hear the news quickly enough.
Mr. Dround was the president of our corporation, and
the most influential single stockholder. With his ideas,
he might become a nuisance, or draw out altogether,
which would be awkward in the present condition of the
company.</p>

<p>As for Farson, I always counted a good deal on that
crusty bit of rock, and he had never failed me yet. One
thing after another had come up in the last four years,
and he and his friends had backed me solidly. We were
pretty deep in other enterprises than this packing business&mdash;railroads
and land in that Southwest where
I had set my eyes. While the scandal was the worst
we never heard a word from Farson, and I was congratulating
myself that he had overlooked the matter,
when one morning I received a despatch: "Meet me
Union Station twelve to-morrow. <span class="smcap">Farson.</span>" That
was all.</p>

<p>When he got out of the sleeper that noon I missed
his usual warm smile. He refused my invitation to
lunch at the City Club, and led the way into the fly-specked,
smelly restaurant at the station. We ate our
miserable meal, and he said little while I talked to him
about our affairs. It was like talking to a blank wall:
he listened but said nothing. After a while he interrupted
me in a kind of thin whisper, as if his mind had
been absent all the time:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about this Judge Garretson? It isn't true?"</p>

<p>"You mean what the papers say?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman didn't like newspapers. But he
waived that aside with a frown.</p>

<p>"The facts!" he whispered across the table. "I should
not have mentioned it had it not been for a conversation
which I had the other day in New York with Judge
Sloan, of the Chicago bar. He tells me that it is generally
believed to be true that this Garretson was bribed,
and that my old friend Jeff Slocum was mixed up in it.
He says that Slocum has lost his reputation among the
best men of the profession on account of his connection
with this scandal. What are the facts?"</p>

<p>"This is hardly the place to go into all that," I replied
somewhat tartly.</p>

<p>"I don't know but that the place is good enough," the
banker observed dryly, "provided you have the right
things to say." But he took the frost out of his
severe tone by one of his most genial smiles, and
added more gently:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps you young men don't realize how serious it
is to have such rumors get around about your reputation.
Why, my boy, it puts you in another class! You are no
longer gentlemen, who can be trusted with honest people's
money and confidence."</p>

<p>Farson would be a hard man to bring to my point of
view! I said by way of allegory:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When a man comes out of the alley and puts a pistol
in your face, and asks for all the money you have on you,
you don't wait to see where you hit him, do you? We don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
here in Chicago. The men who are making all this talk
were the hold-ups, and they did not get our money." I
laughed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i239" id="i239"></a>
<img src="images/i239.jpg" width="450" height="255" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>When a man comes out of the alley and puts a pistol in your face,

see where you hit him, do you?</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>But he did not laugh with me&mdash;instead, he shut up
like a clam all at once. He finished his corned beef
hash and tea, making a few remarks about the train
service on the road he had come over. I asked him
some questions about our railroad matters, but he merely
mumbled "Um, um" to all I had to say. Finally he
said with his usual calm courtesy that he had some
letters to write, and as the train for the West he was
to take did not leave for some time he would not detain
me, but would go upstairs to the waiting-room and write
his letters. So he seized his worn old grip and marched
off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cursed old Maine Yankee," I said to myself, and I
repeated the remark over the telephone to Slocum, telling
him the result of my luncheon with the banker.</p>

<p>"Maybe so," the lawyer telephoned back. "But we
can't afford to let him get his back up."</p>

<p>"It's up already&mdash;he's been talking with Sloan, and I
gather the judge didn't speak highly of you or me."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," came the answer over the wire, and
Slocum's voice sounded dreary. "That kind of thing
dies hard."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> dying hard, and no doubt about it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>As every one knows, the recovery of business from
that awful fit of depression which followed '93 was slow.
At times it would seem that the country was ready to
throw off its fit of sickness and begin to grow again.
Then there would come along some new set-back, and we
were all in the dumps once more.</p>

<p>It had been a great fight to keep the Meat Products
Company afloat during these hard times. It was all we
could do to pay our fixed charges, which were heavy, as
most of the concerns that formed the corporation had
demanded bonds in payment for their properties before
they would consent to join us. There was also, of course,
a big issue of stock, preferred and common, which, by a
mutual agreement, was not to be marketed for three
years. We had not yet come in sight of a dividend on
this stock; hence there were signs of dissatisfaction
among the little fellows, who had expected wonders of
the company. And the time was fast approaching when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
they would be at liberty to dump their stock on the
market for what they could get for it.</p>

<p>The Strauss crowd, since their secret attempt through
the tool Frost and his "syndicate" to thwart our plans,
had kept their hands off us. They knew well enough
what was our financial condition, and were biding their
time to strike. But so far, clear down to the winter of
'96, we had been able to meet all interest charges
promptly, and had thus kept the corporation from foreclosure.
That year as the time approached for the March
payment of interest on the bonds and sinking-fund requirement,
it became evident that our treasury would not
be able to meet the sum required, and that it would be
necessary for us to borrow for the immediate emergency.
We already had a good deal of our paper out in Chicago,
and so Slocum and I went East to raise what we needed.
That was not so easy as it would have been in the days
when we could rely on Farson's aid. But after considerable
efforts we got together in New York what was needed
for the emergency, and I left for home. That was the
fourteenth of February. I congratulated myself that the
danger was past, for I was sure that, with the opening of
our new plant in Kansas City, and the constant improvement
in our business, we ought to be beyond attack when
the next payment was due in the fall. After that period
we should be on the road to dividends.</p>

<p>I had been at home a couple of days, my attention given
to other matters of importance, when one morning notice
came from the Mercantile National Bank, where we did
most of our business, that some large notes were called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
We had over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
"call" loans due that bank, and though, during these
uncertain times, we could not get any long paper, the
management of the Mercantile had been friendly to us
from the start, and I had no reason to anticipate trouble
in that quarter. But when I went over to see the Mercantile
people I met with only a polite and cool reception.
The loans were called; they must be paid; money
was hardening, and so on. It was a granite wall, with
just as much human consideration in it as stone and steel&mdash;and
back I went to my office to think.</p>

<p>There was more than the ordinary bankers' caution in
this sudden financial frost; and, whatever was the power
working against us, it was strong enough to close the
doors of credit throughout the city. Wherever I went
those dreary two days, from bank to bank, I was met
with the same refusal: money was not to be had on any
terms. The word had gone out that we were a doomed
ship, and not a bank would touch our paper. After
a second sleepless night I made up my mind to a desperate
step, with the feeling that if it failed the game
was up.</p>

<p>As soon as I reached my office on the last day of grace
I got old Strauss himself on the telephone and asked
for an appointment. He was gracious enough when I
reached his office; it was the cordiality of a hungry eater
before a good meal.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Harrington?" he purred.</p>

<p>I cut into the meat of the matter at once.</p>

<p>"What are your terms?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you mean that you wish to sell your property?"
he asked indifferently.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it."</p>

<p>"Then how can I help you, Mr. Harrington?" he inquired
blandly.</p>

<p>"You can take your hand off the banks, and let us get
a living."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly, as if I gave
him credit for too much power, and we had it out at some
length. He had no interest in the Meat Products Company.
If the corporation went into the hands of a receiver,
he and his friends might consider buying it up,
and he was willing to discuss terms if we wished to deal
in a friendly manner before it reached the courts. I rose
from my chair as if to go.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Strauss," I said dryly. "You have
made it impossible for us to get any money in Chicago,
but you don't own the earth. There is money in New
York&mdash;about four hundred thousand dollars lying there
for me at this moment."</p>

<p>"To pay the interest on your bonds!" he shot back,
showing how closely he had followed us.</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted, "to meet our March interest and
sinking fund. But I am going across the street to the
telegraph office to wire it out here and take up our paper."</p>

<p>He looked at me inquiringly, waiting for the next move.</p>

<p>"And the March interest?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"We shall default."</p>

<p>The old dog raised his eyebrows, as if to say that was
what he had been waiting for all along.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," I went on, "that is what you have been
working for, and that is why the Mercantile people come
down on us at this moment. You think you have got us
where you can squeeze the life out of us. Well, you have."</p>

<p>"You are a smart young man, Harrington," the great
packer replied genially. "But you have got into a big
game. You'd much better have listened to Carmichael
when he offered you a chance with us."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i245" id="i245"></a>
<img src="images/i245.jpg" width="450" height="297" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption"><i>"Only this," I said slowly, "I don't sell out to you."</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Thanks!" I said glumly.</p>

<p>"Now, why can't we avoid a fight and settle this matter
between ourselves? There might be something good
in it for you."</p>

<p>"I know the way you settle such matters."</p>

<p>"According to your own talk, there isn't much left for
you folks."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only this," I said slowly, and I walked back to his
desk and leaned over it: "I don't sell out to you. We
default. The bonds will be foreclosed, and maybe your
crowd will hold the majority of 'em. But when we get
into the courts, Mr. Strauss, on a receivership, I go
before the judge and tell the story. I have the papers,
too. And part of that story will have to do with certain
agreements which our company has made with you and
the other packers. And more than that, behind these
arrangements there are a lot more of the same kind in
our safe that we got from Dround and others. Now, if
you want the whole story of the packing business aired
in court and in the papers throughout the country, you'll
have your wish."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he said coolly, "you don't suppose that
bluff counts! They can't do a thing to us."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," I replied. "Nothing more than a congressional
investigation, perhaps. And that might block
your little game."</p>

<p>"Go on, young feller!" he exclaimed contemptuously.</p>

<p>"That's all. I want you to know that I am in this
fight to the end, and if it ruins me and my friends, I will
see that it hurts you. Now, if you want to fight, let the
bank call this money."</p>

<p>We had some more talk on the same subject, and,
though the great packer maintained an air of indifference,
I thought I had made some impression on him.
Then we parted, and the old fellow paid me the compliment
of seeing me as far as the door of his office.</p>

<p>From Strauss's place I went to the telegraph office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
wired for the money in New York, and in due time presented
myself at the Mercantile Bank ready to take up
the notes, as I had told Strauss. The president of the
bank was waiting for me with a flurried look on his face.</p>

<p>"You have come in to renew your paper, Mr. Harrington?"
he remarked, as if there had been no trouble
between us.</p>

<p>"No," I said; "I have come to pay what we owe. I
don't do any more business with you."</p>

<p>"We have reconsidered the matter, and we shall be
very glad to renew your paper."</p>

<p>Strauss had seen the point to my remarks, and concluded
to retreat!</p>

<p>"Thank you, I don't care to get any more call money
from you fellows," I said placidly. "You make too much
trouble."</p>

<p>Well, when I left the president's room I had arranged
for a loan of four hundred thousand dollars for six
months. I had measured myself against the great
Strauss, and never again would the big fellow seem to
me so terrible. I judged that, for a time, the American
Meat Products Company would be left to do business
undisturbed....</p>

<p>On my desk, when I returned from the bank that
afternoon, was a telegram from Mr. Dround from New
York: "We arrived to-day&mdash;leaving for Chicago."</p>

<p>For once, Mr. Dround had made up his mind in a
hurry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="chap">JUDGMENTS</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Mrs. Dround once more&mdash;The point of view&mdash;Reflections&mdash;A
family discussion&mdash;May delivers her ultimatum&mdash;We part&mdash;The
middle age of life</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"In Rome you must do as the Romans, or be done!" I
quoted jocularly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround smiled appreciatively.</p>

<p>"From all accounts you have been a tremendous
Roman!"</p>

<p>"Well, at least I haven't been done&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>Jane Dround smiled again and turned her face from the
window of the library, through which could be seen dots
of ice and snow sailing out on the blue lake. The years
she had been gone in Europe had dealt lightly with her.
She had grown a trifle stouter, and looked splendidly
well&mdash;dark, and strong, and full of life.</p>

<p>"I did my best," she continued half humorously. "I
tried to get lost in darkest Africa beyond the reach
of telegrams and newspapers. But a party of Chicago
people coming up the Nile crossed the path of our daha-biyeh,
recognized us, came abroad&mdash;and brought the
story. Cables wouldn't hold him then! We came as
the crow flies; it was no use to plead sickness&mdash;he was
ready to leave me behind in Paris!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed again genially.</p>

<p>"It was nothing much to get excited about," I replied
a little impatiently; "and it has passed now, anyway,
like a winter snow in the city&mdash;slush, water, nothing!"</p>

<p>"But the principle! You forget the principle!" she
remonstrated dryly.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;and he's going to resign from the presidency&mdash;that
ought to satisfy his principle&mdash;but we must keep
him on the board."</p>

<p>"It was a judge, too! A sworn officer of the law!"
Mrs. Dround interrupted, quoting demurely from Henry
I's remarks about the injunction scandal.</p>

<p>"Very well, he can make over his stock to you, then!
It won't trouble you, and you can draw the big dividends
we are going to pay soon. I don't want him to get out
now, when the fruit is almost ripe to shake."</p>

<p>"Is that the only reason?" Mrs. Dround asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Of course, we don't want his stock coming on the
market in a big block. It would break us all up. And
it might easily get into the wrong hands."</p>

<p>For Mr. Dround, in the brief interview that we had
had on his return, had intimated his desire not only to
withdraw from the presidency of the corporation, which
had been merely a nominal office, but to dispose of his
stock as soon as the agreement expired in the fall, suggesting
that I had best find some friendly hands to take
his big holding. In his gentlemanly way he had told
me that he had had enough of me and was quite ready
to snow me under, if it could be done in a polite and
friendly fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you want him to wait?" Mrs. Dround suggested
indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes, until I am ready!"</p>

<p>She made no reply to this remark, and after a moment
I said more lightly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I came to welcome you home,&mdash;I want you still
to be my friend, my partner!"</p>

<p>"They say you are a dangerous partner," she retorted,
looking closely at me,&mdash;"deep in all sorts of speculative
schemes, and likely to slip. They say you are
un&mdash;scrupulous"&mdash;she drawled the word mockingly&mdash;"and
a lot more bad things. Do you think that is the
right kind of partner for a simple woman?"</p>

<p>"If you've got the nerve!"</p>

<p>"Well, let me show you some of the new pictures
we have bought." And she turned me off with a lot of
talk about pictures and stuffs and stones, until I arose
to leave.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Shortly afterwards my carriage took me back to the
city, where I had to meet some gentlemen who were
interested in my schemes for the development of the new
Southwest. As I rode through the windy, dusty streets,
my thoughts went back over the years since that time
when at the suggestion of this woman I had just left, I
had put my hand to building something large out of
Henry I. Dround's tottering estate.</p>

<p>In a busy life like mine, one event shades into another.
Each path to which a man sets his feet leads to some
cross-roads, and from there any one of the branches will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
lead on to its own cross-roads. While the adventurer is
on his way it is hard to tell why he takes one turning
and not another, why he lays his course here and not
there. Years later he may see it plotted plain, as I do
to-day&mdash;plotted as on a map. Then the wanderer may
try to explain what made him move this way or that.
Yet the little determining causes that turned his mind
at the moment of choice are forever forgotten. The big,
permanent motive remains: there is the broad highroad&mdash;but
why was it left, why this turn and double across
the main track?</p>

<p>So it was with me. The main highroad of my ambition
was almost lost in the thickets in which I found
myself. Struggling day by day against the forces that
opposed me, I had lost sight of direction. The words
with Jane Dround, the flash of her dark eyes, pierced
my obscurity, gave me again a view of the destiny to
which I had set myself. Some fire in her fed me with
courage, and made my spirit lighter than it had been
for months....</p>

<p>When I reached home in the evening, I found Sarah
ill with a nervous headache.</p>

<p>"Will is back!" she exclaimed on seeing me, and her
tone scarcely concealed a meaning beyond her words.</p>

<p>"What's that? He didn't send me word that he was
coming."</p>

<p>"May telephoned&mdash;he's just got in."</p>

<p>Something unexpected must have brought him suddenly
all the way from Texas, where he was looking
after our interests. The news was disturbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw Jane Dround this afternoon," I remarked idly.
"She's looking fine&mdash;never saw her better."</p>

<p>"Jane!" my wife said slowly. "So she's back once
more." Then after a pause she exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't like her!"</p>

<p>Sarah, who rarely said a bitter word about any one,
spoke this harshly, and I looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't trust that woman, Van! She is secret. And
I believe she influenced you&mdash;that time about the
judge."</p>

<p>It was the first time for months that Sarah had referred
to this matter.</p>

<p>"I'll go and ring up May," I said, not caring to refute
this wild accusation, "and ask them to come over to-night."</p>

<p>"I asked them for dinner, but she wouldn't come,"
Sarah remarked gloomily. "No one wants to come here
but people like the Webbs and Coopers&mdash;people who
think they can make something out of your schemes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they aren't the only ones who are willing
to come. And what's the matter with the Webbs and
the Coopers? If the rest of your friends don't like us,
we can get along without their society. I guess New
York will stand us, and that's where we shall be before
many years, if all goes well. This place is only a gossipy
old village."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to New York!" Sarah wailed.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When I had May at the telephone, she answered my
invitation in a dry little voice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, we are coming over to see you about a matter.
Will has something important to say to you."</p>

<p>By the tone of May's voice I judged that we should
have a rather lively family party, and I was not mistaken.
Sarah was still lying on the lounge in my study
when Will and May came in after dinner. There was
battle in May's eyes and in her tight-shut lips. It had
been a long time since she had come to the house when I
was at home. And to-night Will, too, was looking very
pale and troubled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i253" id="i253"></a>
<img src="images/i253.jpg" width="450" height="353" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>Couldn't you find any one else to do your dirty work but your
own brother?</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>"May," I said, "you look as if you had a gun trained
on me. Fire away, only make it something new. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
tired of that old matter about the judge. 'Most everybody
has forgotten all about that except you and Sarah."</p>

<p>"It's something new, fast enough, Van; but it isn't
any better," she retorted. "Couldn't you find any one
else to do your dirty work but your own brother?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"Show him the article, Will."</p>

<p>Will unbuttoned his coat and reached for his inner
pocket. From it he hauled out a bulky newspaper,
which he handed me. It was a copy of the Sunday
<i>Texas World</i>, and a front page article was heavily pencilled.</p>

<p>"That's too much, Van," he protested solemnly, handing
me the paper. "Read it."</p>

<p>"Yes, read it all!" May added. The three were silent
while I ran through the article. It was the usual exaggerated
sort of newspaper stuff purporting to describe
the means used to secure a piece of railroad legislation,
in which I and some New York men were interested.
The sting lay in the last paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"It is commonly understood that the lobby which has
been working for the past winter in the interest of this
rotten bill is maintained by a group of powerful capitalists,
dominated by the head of a large Chicago packing
company. This gentleman, who suddenly shot into publicity
the past winter as the result of an unusually brazen
attempt to corrupt a Chicago judge, has opened his office
not three blocks from the state Capitol, and has put his
brother in charge of the corruptionist forces.... The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
deserving legislators of our state may soon expect to reap
a rich harvest!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A few more generalities wound up the article. I folded
the paper and handed it back to Will. No one said a
word for a few moments, and then Will observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That isn't pleasant reading for an honorable man!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how it should trouble you, Will. You
are down there to look after our interests in a legitimate
way enough. If you don't like the job, though, I can
get another man to take your place."</p>

<p>"Van," May interrupted, "don't try to squirm! You
know that's true&mdash;what's written there! You didn't
ask Will to use the bribe money, because you knew he
wouldn't do anything dishonorable. But you let him
take the blame, and sent some one else with the money,
no doubt. What was that partner of Mr. Slocum's sent
down there for?"</p>

<p>"Will,"&mdash;I turned to my brother,&mdash;"let us settle
this by ourselves. It's a man's business, and the women
won't help us."</p>

<p>"No, Van," May replied. "I guess we women are as
much concerned as anybody. Where there's a question
of my husband's honor, it's my business, too. I stay."</p>

<p>"Well, then, stay! And try to understand. This bill
the paper rips up is all right. We must have it to put
our road through to the Gulf, and if it were not for the
money the Pacific Western road, which owns the state,
is putting up against us we shouldn't have any trouble.
They want to keep us out, and Strauss and his crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
want to keep us out, too, so that they can have all the pie
to themselves. I have been working at this thing for
years in order that we can get an outlet to the seaboard,
untouched by our rivals. They think to block us just at
the end, but I guess they find out they are mistaken
when the line comes next month. That's all!"</p>

<p>"Do you think that explanation is satisfactory? Of
course, Van, you want the bill passed!" May said
ironically.</p>

<p>"What does it mean&mdash;what has Van been doing?"
Sarah asked for the first time, sitting up and looking
from one to another in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>None of us answered, and finally Will said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I guess, Van, you and I don't see things quite the
same way. I know you wouldn't ask me to do what you
thought was bad, but all the same there's too much that's
true in that piece in the paper, and I don't want to have
it said&mdash;there's things going on down there that aren't
right&mdash;and May feels&mdash;I feel myself, that it ain't right.
We don't think the same way, you and I. So we had
better part now, before we have any bad feeling."</p>

<p>"All right! Did you come over here to-night to tell
me that?"</p>

<p>"No, Van," May put in hastily, her voice trembling
with feeling. "That wasn't all. Will and I came to ask
you to give up the sort of business you are doing down
there. We want you to turn back into the right road
before it is too late. If you don't land in the penitentiary,
Van Harrington, your money will do you no good.
It will taste bad all your life!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>We were all pretty well stirred up by this time. I
was weary of meeting these charges of dishonesty on all
sides. This last was too much&mdash;to have my family
accuse me of a crime, when I did not feel guilty, not for
a minute!</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should say that, May!" Sarah
suddenly bridled. "After all, it's only the newspapers,
and no one believes them to-day."</p>

<p>This unexpected defence from Sarah aroused May
afresh.</p>

<p>"Oh, he don't deny it! He can't. First it was a
judge&mdash;he bought a judge and paid for him, and he
never came out and denied it! Now it's worse even than
that. It's the people of a whole state he's trying to buy
through their representatives."</p>

<p>"Who are there for sale," I laughed.</p>

<p>"Does that make it any better?" she turned on me.
"Seems to me, Van, you don't know any longer the difference
between black and white!"</p>

<p>"We've got a perfect right to build that road, and build
it we will&mdash;that's all there is to that matter!"</p>

<p>And so we argued for hours, May and I doing most of
the talking. For I wanted her to understand just how
the matter lay. No business in this large, modern world
could be done on her plan of life. That beautiful scheme
of things which the fathers of our country drew up in the
stage-coach days had proved itself inadequate in a short
century. We had to get along with it the best we could.
But we men who did the work of the world, who developed
the country, who were the life and force of the times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
could not be held back by the swaddling-clothes of any
political or moral theory. Results we must have: good
results; and we worked with the tools we found at hand.</p>

<p>"It's no use your saying any more!" May exclaimed
at last. "I understand just what you mean, Van Harrington.
It's the same way it was with the judge's
peaches. You wanted 'em, and you took 'em! What
you want you think is good for every one, especially for
Van Harrington. And you are so wise and strong you
think you can breakthrough all laws because laws are made
for small people, like Will and me, and you and your
kind are Napoleons. You talk as if you were a part of
God's destiny. And I say"&mdash;here her voice broke for
a moment&mdash;"I say, Van, you are the devil's instrument!
You and those like you&mdash;and there a good many of
them&mdash;are just plain big rascals, only the laws can't
get hold of you."</p>

<p>Her lips trembled and at the end broke into that
little ironical smile which I knew so well, the smile she
had when I used to get into some boyish scrape, and she
was looking through me for the truth. But for all her
hot words, I knew she had kindly feeling for me somewhere
in her heart. Nevertheless, Sarah, who had been
following our talk as well as she could, fired up at her
accusations.</p>

<p>"I think, May," she remonstrated with all her dignity,
"that you cannot say any more such things in my
husband's house."</p>

<p>"Yes," I added, "we have had too much talk all around.
You can't change my character any more than you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
make wheat grow in Arizona or sugar-cane in Dakota.
And I don't want to change your views, either, May."</p>

<p>For though she made me pretty angry, I admired the
way she stood to her guns. She was a fighter! And
Will must act as she decided. Whoever travelled with
her would have to travel by her star.</p>

<p>"Yes," my brother replied, "it's gone too far now to
change. Words don't do any good. Come, wife, let
us go."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for Sarah!" May said, taking Sarah's
hands in hers. "She suffers for you, Van, and she will
suffer for this all her life. But I am sorrier for you,
Van, for you have gone too far to suffer!"</p>

<p>Thereupon she swept out of the room, her little figure
swelling with dignity; and Will followed her, as the
needle swings to its magnet, pausing only long enough
to reach for my hand and press it. When the front door
shut upon them the house seemed suddenly cold and
empty. Sarah had slipped back to the lounge, and was
staring up at the ceiling, a tear trickling across her face.</p>

<p>"I suppose May won't ever come back again. And we
were planning to take that cottage this summer so that
the children could be together."</p>

<p>That detail didn't seem to me very important, but it
was the one that showed to Sarah the gulf which had
opened between us. Sarah's little world, by that token,
had suffered an earthquake.</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, trying to comfort her, "like as not this
will blow over! May has disapproved of me before
this."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>But in my heart I felt there wasn't much likelihood
that this breach would be healed. Knowing May as I
did, I had no idea that she would let Will continue with
me, even in another position. No compromise for her!
To-morrow or next day Will would come into the office
to take his leave....</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Somehow years had gone by in
that evening.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"I guess, Van, I'll go to
bed."</p>

<p>It was the first word
Sarah had spoken for half
an hour. The tears had
dried on her face. She
gave me a light kiss, and
left me....</p>

<p>The house seemed cold
and desolate, as if the
pleasant kindliness of life
had gone out of it when
my brother and his wife
had left. I made up the
fire, lighted a fresh cigar,
and sat down to think.
Somehow years had gone
by in that evening; I was
heavy with the heaviness
of middle life.</p>

<p>To take the other road, her road&mdash;that was what
May demanded of me. How little she knew the situation!
That would mean immediate ruin for me and
mine, and for those men who had trusted me with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
money. The world that I had been building all these
years would crumble and vanish like smoke into the void
out of which I had made it! Not that May's talk had
meaning or sense to it, either. Nor do men made as I
am alter at the sound of words. We are as we are, and
we grow with the power to do that which we must do.
May was merely an unreasonable and narrow woman,
who saw but one kind of good.</p>

<p>In all the forty years of my life there had been no
evil as I know evil. No man could say that he had
harm from me&mdash;unless it might be poor Ed Hostetter&mdash;and
for thousands of such workers as live from day
to day, depending on men like me to give them their
chance to earn bread for their wives and children, I had
made the world better rather than worse. Unthinking
thousands lived and had children and got what good
there was in life because of me and my will.</p>

<p>But to the others, the good ones, to Farson and Dround
and May, I was but a common thief, a criminal, who
fattened on the evil of the world. What had they done
to make life? What was their virtue good for? They
took the dainty paths and kept their clothes from the
soil of the road. Yes, and what then? A renewed
sense of irritation rose within me. Why should I be
pestered like this, why should I lose my brother and
May, why should Sarah be hurt, because they were too
good to do as I had done?</p>

<p>So my brother and May went their way. They left
me lonely. For the first time since the day, many
years before, when I walked out of the police station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
alone into the city, the loneliness of life came over me.
To-morrow, in the daylight, in the fierce fight of the day,
that weakness would go; but to-night there was no hand
to reach, no voice to speak, from the multitude of the
world. One person only of all would know, would place
big and little side by side and reckon them rightly&mdash;would
understand the ways I had followed to get my
ends. Jane Dround would throw them all a smile of
contempt, the little ones who weigh and hesitate!</p>

<p>There was the soul of the fighter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="chap">HAPPINESS</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>I learn of Mr. Dround's intentions&mdash;A plea for myself&mdash;Despots&mdash;A
woman's heart&mdash;The two in the world that are most near&mdash;Sarah's
cry&mdash;Jane defends herself&mdash;To go away forever&mdash;Vows
renewed</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"Henry is simply furious&mdash;thinks his name has been
involved&mdash;and he means to sell every share of stock he
holds as soon as the agreement expires."</p>

<p>"I knew that he would do just that!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dround threw back her coat and looked up with
a mischievous smile on her face. She was a very handsome
woman these days, not a month older than when I
saw her first. She had reached that point where Nature,
having done her best for a woman, pauses before beginning
the work of destruction.</p>

<p>She had come this afternoon to call on Sarah, and,
having failed to find her at home, was writing a note at
her desk, when I came in from the day's business, a little
earlier than was my wont.</p>

<p>"It isn't just that matter of the injunction. You
know, my friend, people here in the city&mdash;Henry's
friends&mdash;say that you are engaged in dangerous enterprises&mdash;that
you are a desperate man yourself! Are
you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know better than most!" I answered lightly.
"But I am getting tired of all this talk. I had a dose of
it in the family the last time."</p>

<p>She nodded as I briefly related what had happened
with Will and May.</p>

<p>"And, of course, Sarah feels pretty badly," I concluded.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" she murmured. "I wondered what
was the matter with her these days. She will feel differently
later. But your brother, that is another question."</p>

<p>"He and his wife will never feel differently."</p>

<p>She tossed aside the pen she held and rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Never mind! I know you don't mind really&mdash;only
it is too bad to have this annoyance just now, when you
have much on your shoulders. I wish I could <i>do</i> something!
A woman's hands are always tied!"</p>

<p>She could say no more, and we sat for some time
without further talk. I was thinking what would happen
when Mr. Dround's stock was dumped on the market,
to be snapped up by my enemies. Our company
was very near the point of paying dividends, and with
a friendly line of railroad giving us an outlet into the
Southwest, the struggling venture would be in a powerful
position.</p>

<p>"If he would wait but six months more!" I broke out
at last.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Where a question of principle is involved,&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her lips curved ironically.</p>

<p>"What would <i>you</i> do, tell me, if a parcel of scamps
were holding you up for the benefit of your enemies?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Suppose you had a perfect right to do the business you had
in hand. Would you put tail between legs and get out
and leave your bone to the other dog?"</p>

<p>"If I wanted to starve, yes! I should deserve to."</p>

<p>"You and I think surprisingly alike very often!"</p>

<p>"I always liked despots," she replied. "And, as a
matter of fact, despots&mdash;the strong ones&mdash;have always
really done things. They do to-day&mdash;only we make a
fuss about it and get preachy. No, my friend, don't hesitate!
The scrupulous ones will bow to you in time."</p>

<p>"You would have made something of a man!"</p>

<p>She bowed her head mockingly.</p>

<p>"That is man's best compliment to poor, weak woman.
But I am content, when I touch the driving hand, now
and then."</p>

<p>After a time she added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will find the way. It is not the last ditch, far
from it. A man like you cannot be killed with one
blow!"</p>

<p>She had given the warning, done what she could, and
now she trusted me to do the rest. Her will, her sympathy,
were strong behind me. So when this moment
was over, when she went her way and I mine, out into
the world of cares and struggle, I might carry with me
this bit of her courage, her sureness. I felt that, and I
wanted to say it to her, to let her see that it was more
herself than her good will or her help that I valued.
But it was an awkward thing to say.</p>

<p>Her hands lay upon the desk between us. They were
not beautiful hands, merely strong, close-knit&mdash;hands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
hold with a grip of death. I looked at them, thinking
that in her hands was the sign of her character. She
raised her eyes and gazed at me steadily for several
moments.</p>

<p>"You know how I feel?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't need a woman's sympathy&mdash;but I want
you to know how I feel&mdash;for my own sake."</p>

<p>"Thank you for it. In this life a man must stand
pretty much alone, win or lose. I have always found it so&mdash;except
when you and I have talked things over. That
hasn't been often. This is a tight place I find myself in
now. But there is a way out, or if there isn't&mdash;well, I
have played the game better than most."</p>

<p>"Even that thought doesn't give happiness," she mused.
"I know, because, my friend, I, too, have stood alone all
my life."</p>

<p>She gave me this confidence simply, as a man might.</p>

<p>"I suppose a woman counts on happiness," I said awkwardly
in response. "But I have never counted much
on that. There have always been many things to do,
and I have done them, well or ill I can't say. But I have
done them somehow."</p>

<p>It was a clumsy answer, but I could find no proper
words for what I felt. Such things are not to be said.
There followed another of those full silences which
counted with this woman for so much more than words.
Again it was she who broke it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For once, only once, I want to speak out plainly!
You are younger than I, my friend,&mdash;not so much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
years as in other things. Enough, so that I can look at
you as&mdash;a friend. You understand?"</p>

<p>She spoke gently, with a little smile, as if, after all,
all this must be taken between us for a joke.</p>

<p>"From the beginning, when you and Sarah first came
into our lives, I saw the kind of man you were, and I
admired you. I wanted to help you&mdash;yes, to help you."</p>

<p>"And that you did!"</p>

<p>"Not really. Perhaps no one could really help you.
No one helps or hinders. You work out your fate from
the inside, like all the powerful ones. You do what is in
you to do, and never question. But I longed for the
woman's satisfaction of being something to you,&mdash;of
holding the sponge, as the boys say. But a mere woman,
poor, weak creature, is tied with a short rope&mdash;do you
know what that means? So the next best thing, if one
can't live one's self, is to live in another&mdash;some strong
one. When you are a woman and have reached my age,
you know that you can't live for yourself. That chance
has gone."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," I protested. "You are just ready
to live."</p>

<p>She gave me a smile for my compliment, and shook
her head.</p>

<p>"No, I don't deceive myself. Most women do. I know
when I have reached the end of my chapter.... So I
have followed you, step by step&mdash;oh, you don't know
how closely! And I have sucked in all the joy of your
success, of your power, of you&mdash;a man! I have lived a
man's life."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you went away?" I said accusingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I went away&mdash;because that would help! It
was the only thing I could do&mdash;I could go away."</p>

<p>For the first time her voice shook with passion. I was
answered.</p>

<p>"Now I have come back to find that my hands are
tied more than ever. I can help you no more. Believe
me, that is the hardest thing yet. I can help you no
more! My husband&mdash;you understand? No, you need
not understand. A woman is bound back and across by
a thousand threads, which do not always show to the
eye.... I may yet keep my husband from throwing
you over, but that is no matter&mdash;the truth is I count no
longer to you. If the world had been other than it is, my
friend, I should have been by your side, fighting it out
daily for you, with you. As it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>She threw up her arms in a gesture of disgust and remained
silent, brooding. It was not necessary to complete
the words. Nor could I speak. Something very wonderful
and precious was passing before my eyes for the last time,
something that had been near was floating off, would
never come back. And life was so made that it was vain,
useless, to try to hold it, to cry out, to do anything except
to be still and feel the loss. My hands fell beside hers
upon the polished surface of the desk, and we sat looking
into one another's eyes, without fear. She was feeling
what I was feeling, but she was looking deeper into fate
than I could look. For she was wiser as a woman than
I was as a man. We were the two in the world most
near, and between us there was a gulf that could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
crossed. The years that are to come, my heart said to
me then, will be longer than those that have passed.</p>

<p>"Listen," she whispered, as though she were reading
my thoughts. "We shall never need more than this.
Remember! Nothing more than this. For I should be a
hindrance, then, not a help. And that would be the end
of me, indeed. You have your will to work, which is more
than any woman could give you. And I have the thought
of you. Now I must go away again&mdash;we have to live that
way. It makes no difference: you and I think the same
thoughts in the same way. What separation does a little
distance put between you and me? I shall follow after
you step by step, and when you have mounted to the
broad level that comes after accomplishment, you will be
glad that it has been as I say, not different. It is I that
must long. For you need no woman to comfort and
love you!"</p>

<p>It was finished, and we sat in the deepening twilight
beyond words. The truth of what she had spoken filled
my mind. There was nothing else for us two but what
we had had: we had come to the top of ourselves to
know this, to look it in the face, and to put it aside....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The twilight silence was broken sharp in two by a cry
that rang across the room. We started from our dream
together and looked around. Sarah was standing midway
in the long room, steadying herself by a hand
reached out to a chair. I ran to hold her from falling.
She grasped my arm and walked on unsteadily toward Jane.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it always!" she cried harshly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"You tortuous woman&mdash;you are taking him from me!
You did it from the first day! How I hate you!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i270" id="i270"></a>
<img src="images/i270.jpg" width="450" height="508" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>No, child, you are wrong! There is no truth in your cruel words.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>She dropped into a chair and sobbed. Jane knelt
down by her side and, grasping her hands, spoke to her
in low, pleading words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, child, you are wrong! You wrong <i>him</i>. He is
not such a man. There is no truth in your cruel words."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have made him do dishonorable things.
He has acted so his own family have left him. I know
it is <i>you</i>!" she sobbed. "He has done what you would
have him do."</p>

<p>"Child, child!" Jane exclaimed impatiently, shaking
gently the hands she held. "What do you mean by saying
such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't he done all those bad things? He never
denied it, not when he was accused in church before
every one. And May said it was true."</p>

<p>She looked resentfully at Jane through her tears.
The older woman still smiled at her and stroked her
hands.</p>

<p>"But even if it were true, <i>you</i> mustn't take the part of
his accusers! That isn't for a woman who loves him to
do. You must trust him to the end."</p>

<p>Sarah looked at her and then at me. She pushed
Jane from her quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't you defend him to me! You have stolen him!
He loves you. I saw it once before, and I see it on your
face now. I know it!"</p>

<p>"Come!" I said, taking Sarah by the arm and leading
her away. "You don't know what you say."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! You treat me like a child, Van! Why
did you have to take him?" she turned and flamed out
to Jane. "You have always had everything."</p>

<p>"Have I had everything?" the other woman questioned
slowly, quietly, as if musing to herself. "Everything?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Do you know all, child? Let me tell you one thing.
Once I had a child&mdash;a son. One child! And he was
born blind. He lived four months. Those were the
only months I think I have ever lived. Do you think
that I have had <i>all</i> the joy?"</p>

<p>She was stirred, at last, passionate, ironic, and Sarah
looked at her with wondering surprise, with awe.</p>

<p>"You grudge me the three or four hours your husband
has given me out of the ten years you have lived with
him! You hate me because he has talked to me as he
would talk to himself&mdash;as he would talk to you each
day, if you could read the first letter of his mind. And
if I love him? If he loves me? Would you deny yourself
the little I have taken from you, his wife, if it were
yours to take and <i>mine</i> to lose? But be content! Not
one word of what you call love has passed between us,
or ever will. Is that enough?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other with hate plainly written
on their faces.</p>

<p>"You are a bad woman!" Sarah exclaimed brokenly.</p>

<p>"Am I? Think of this, then. I could take your
husband&mdash;I could from this hour! But for his sake,
for <i>his</i> sake, I will not. <i>I will not!</i>"</p>

<p>Sarah groaned, covering her eyes, while Jane walked
rapidly out of the room. In a moment the carriage door
clicked outside, and we were alone.</p>

<p>"You love that woman, Van!" Sarah's voice broke the
silence between us with an accusing moan.</p>

<p>"Why say that&mdash;" I began, and stopped; for, after
this hour, I knew what it was for one person to be close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
to another. However, it seemed a foolish thing to be
talking about. There would be no gain in going deeper
into our hearts.</p>

<p>"There has never been a word between us that you
should not hear," I replied; "and now let us say no
more."</p>

<p>But Sarah shook her head, unconvinced.</p>

<p>"It is two years or more since I have seen Jane," I
added.</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. Jane was right! You
love her!" she repeated helplessly. "What shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" I took her cold hands and sat down
opposite her, drawing her nearer me. "Don't fear, my
wife. They are going away again, I understand. She
will go out of our life for always."</p>

<p>"I have my children," Sarah mused after a pause.</p>

<p>"We have <i>our</i> children," I corrected. "And it's best
to think of them before ourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we could take them and go away to some little
place, to live like my people down in Kentucky&mdash;you
and me and the children!"</p>

<p>I smiled to myself at the thought. To run away was
not just to pack a trunk, as Sarah thought!</p>

<p>"It would be impossible. Everything would go to
pieces. I should lose pretty much all that we have&mdash;not
only that, but a great many other people who have
trusted me with their money would lose. I must work
at least until there is no chance of loss for them."</p>

<p>"But aren't you a very rich man, Van?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so rich as I shall be some day! But I might
make out to live in Kentucky, all the same."</p>

<p>"You think I must have a great deal of money?"</p>

<p>"I always want you to have all that money can get."</p>

<p>"To make up for what I can't have!" She burst into
sobs. "I am so wretched, Van! Everything seems
strange. I have tried to do what is right. But God
must be displeased with me: He has taken from me the
one thing I wanted."</p>

<p>That was a bitter thought to lie between husband and
wife. I took her in my arms and comforted her, and
together we saw that a way lay clear before us, doing our
duty by one another and by our children, and in the end
all would come out well. As we sat there together, it
seemed to me as though there could be two loves in a
man's life,&mdash;the love for the woman and her children,
who are his to protect; and the hunger love at the bottom
of the heart, which with most is never satisfied, and maybe
never can be satisfied in this life.</p>

<p>So she was comforted and after a little time went to
her room, more calm in spirit. Then I called my secretary,
and we worked together until a late hour. When
my mind came back to the personal question of living,
the fire on the hearth had died into cold ashes and the
house was still with the stillness of early morning. For
the moment it came over me that the fight I was waging
with fortune was as cold as these ashes and doomed to
failure. And the end, what was it?</p>

<p>Upstairs, Sarah lay half dressed on the lounge in my
room, asleep. The tears had dried where they had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
on her cheeks and neck. Her hair hung down loosely as
though she had not the will to put it up for the night.
As she lay there asleep, in the disorder of her grief, I
knew that the real sorrow of life was hers, not mine. The
memory of that day of our engagement came back to
me&mdash;when I had wished to protect and cover her from
the hard things of life. And again, as that time, I
longed to take her, the gentle heart so easily hurt, and
save her from this sorrow, the worst that can come to a
loving woman. As I kissed the stained face, she awoke
and looked at me wonderingly, murmuring half asleep:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is it, Van? What has happened? It is time
for you to go to bed. I remember&mdash;something bad has
happened. What is it, Van? Oh, I know now!"</p>

<p>She shuddered as I lifted her from the lounge.</p>

<p>"I remember now what it is. You love that woman,
but I can't let you go. I can't bear it. I can't live
without you!"</p>

<p>"That will never come so long as there is life for us
both," I promised.</p>

<p>She drew her arm tight about my neck.</p>

<p>"Yes! You must love me a little always."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>War! That was what was in the air those days. It
had muttered on for months, giving our politicians at
Washington something to mouth about in their less
serious hours. Then came the sinking of the <i>Maine</i> in
Havana Harbor, and even Wall Street could see that the
country was drifting fast into war. And in their jackal
fashion, the men of Wall Street were trying to make
money out of this crisis of their country, starting rumors
from those high in authority to run the prices of their
goods up and down. To those men who had honest
interests at stake it was a terrible time for panic, for
uncertainty. One could never guess what might happen
over night.</p>

<p>But throughout the land, among the common people,
the question at issue had been heard and judged. The
farmer on his ranch, the laborer in his factory, the hand
on the railroad&mdash;the men of the land up and down the
States&mdash;had judged this question. When the time came
their judgment got itself recorded; for any big question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
is settled just that way by those men, not at Washington
or in Wall Street.</p>

<p>The sick spirit of our nation needed just this tonic of
a generous war, fought not for our own profit. It would
do us good to give ourselves for those poor Cuban dogs.
The Jew spirit of Wall Street doesn't rule this country,
after all, and Wall Street doesn't understand that the
millions in the land long to hustle sometimes for something
besides their own bellies. So, although Wall
Street groaned, I had a kind of faith that war would
be a good thing, cost what it might.</p>

<p>And it might cost me the work of my life. Latterly,
with the revival of trade, my enterprises had been prospering,
and were emerging from that doubtful state
where they were blown upon by every wind of the
market. For the American Meat Products Company
had kept its promise and was earning dividends. It
had paid, in the past year, six per cent on the preferred
stock, and, what with the big contracts we were getting
from the Government just now, it would earn something
on the common. So far very little of our stock had
come upon the market, although the period covered by
the agreement among the stockholders not to sell their
holdings had passed. In spite of Mr. Dround's threats,
there was no evidence that he had disposed of his stock
up to this time. It was probable that when he saw what
a good earner the company had proved to be, he had
reconsidered his scruples, as he had done years before in
the matter of private agreements and rebates.</p>

<p>And that rag of a railroad out of Kansas City, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Farson and his friends found left on their hands in the
panic times of '93, now reached all the way to the Gulf
and was spreading fast into a respectable system. After
Farson had withdrawn his help at the time of our disagreement,
we had interested a firm of bankers in New
York, and, one way and another, had built and equipped
the road. A few years of good times, and all this network
of enterprises would be beyond attack. Meanwhile,
I was loaded down to the water's edge with the securities
of these new companies, and had borrowed heavily at
home and in the East in the effort to push through my
plans.</p>

<p>This was my situation on that eventful day when the
news of the sinking of the <i>Maine</i> was telegraphed over
the country, and even gilt-edged securities began to
tumble, to slide downhill in a mad whirl. In such times
collateral shrank like snow before a south wind.</p>

<p>All the morning I had sat in my office with a telephone
at my ear, and it seemed to me that but one word
came from it&mdash;Collateral! collateral! Where was it to
be had? Finally, I hung up the receiver of my telephone
and leaned back in my chair, dazed by the mad
whirl along which I was being carried. My secretary
opened the door and asked if I would see So-and-so and
the next man. A broker was clamoring to get at me.
They all wanted one thing&mdash;money. Their demands
came home to me faintly, like the noise of rain on a
window.</p>

<p>"Jim," I said to the man, "I am tired. I am going
home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Going home?" he gasped, not believing his ears.</p>

<p>"Tell 'em all I am going home! Tell 'em anything you
want to."</p>

<p>While the young man was still staring at me, Slocum
burst past him into the room. Even his impassive face
was twisted into a scowl of fear.</p>

<p>"Harris is out there," he said hurriedly. "He says
some one is selling Meat Products common and preferred.
Big chunks of it are coming on the market,
and the price has dropped fifteen points during the
morning."</p>

<p>I said nothing. Anything was to be expected in this
whirlwind.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it's Dround's stock?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I nodded. "It don't make much difference
to us whose it is."</p>

<p>"We can't let this go on."</p>

<p>"I guess it will have to go on," I replied listlessly.</p>

<p>Slocum looked at me wonderingly. He had seen me
crawl out of a good many small holes, and he was waiting
for the word of action now.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"I am going home." I got up and took his arm.
"Come along with me, old man. I want to get out of
this noise."</p>

<p>The elevator dropped us into the hurly-burly of the
street. Men were hurrying in and out of the brokers'
offices, where the last reports for the day were coming in.</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n this war!" Slocum swore, as I paused to buy
a paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't say that, Slo!" I protested. "This war is a
great thing, and every decent American ought to be proud
of his country, by thunder! I am."</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at me as if my head had suddenly
gone back on me.</p>

<p>"I mean it. I tell you, Slo, nations are like men.
They have their work to do in this life. When it comes
to an issue like this, they can't shirk any more than a
man can. If they do, it will be worse for them. This
war will do us good, will clean us and cure us for a good
long time of this cussed, little peevish distemper we have
been through since '93. That was just selfish introspection.
This fight for Cuba will bring us all together. We'll
work for something better than our bellies. There's nothing
so good as a dose of real patriotism once in a while."</p>

<p>"Van, you ought to be in the Senate!" he jeered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be there one of these days, when I
have finished this other job."</p>

<p>The idea seemed to strike him humorously.</p>

<p>"You think it might be hard work for me to prove my
patriotism to the people? Don't you believe it. The
people don't remember slander long. And those things
you and I have done which have set the newspapers
talking don't worry anybody. They are just the tricks
of the game."</p>

<p>So we sauntered on through the streets that March
afternoon, discussing, like two schoolboys, patriotism and
government; while back in the office we had left white-faced
men were clamoring for a word with me, seeking
to find out whether I was to go under at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," Slocum finally asked, as he was leaving me,
"what are you going to do about this pinch?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done to-night. I'm going to
read the papers and see what they say about the war.
I am going home. Perhaps to-morrow it will be all over.
Lordy! We'll make a tolerable big smash when we go
down!"</p>

<p>"Get some sleep!" was Slocum's advice.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The papers were red-hot with the war spirit, and they did
me good. Somehow, I was filled with a strange gladness
because of the war. Pride in the people of my country,
who could sacrifice themselves for another people, swelled
my heart. Where could you read of a finer thing in all
history than the way the people's wrath had compelled
the corrupt, self-seeking politicians in Washington to do
their will&mdash;to strike an honest blow, to redeem a suffering
people! It comes not often in any man's life to feel
himself one of a great nation when it arises in a righteous
cause with all the passion of its seventy millions. Let
the panic wipe out my little pile of money. Let the war
break up the dreams of my best years&mdash;I would not for
that selfish cause stay its course. It made a man feel
clean to think there was something greater in life than
himself and his schemes.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>To-day I should like to slip back once more to the bum that landed
in Chicago&mdash;unattached, unburdened, unbound.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I walked on and on in the March twilight, leaving behind
me the noisy city, and the struggle of the market.
Why not go myself&mdash;why not enlist? I suddenly asked
of myself. The very thought of it made me throw up
my head. Slocum could gather up the fragments as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
as I, and there would be enough left in any case for the
children and Sarah. Better that fight than this! When
the President issued a call for volunteers, maybe I could
raise a regiment from our men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The street was shadowed by the solid houses of the
rich, the respectable stone and brick palaces of the "captains
of industry," each big enough to house a dozen
Jasonville families. I looked at them with the eyes of a
stranger, as I had the day when I roamed Chicago in
search of a job. Perhaps I had envied these men then;
but small comfort had I ever had from all the wealth I
had got out of the city. Food and drink, a place to
sleep in, some clothes&mdash;comfort for my wife and children&mdash;what
else? To-day I should like to slip back once
more to the bum that landed in Chicago&mdash;unattached,
unburdened, unbound....</p>

<p>I let myself into the silent house. Sarah and the
children were at our place in Vermilion County, where
I had a house and two thousand acres of good land,
to which I escaped for a few days now and then. I had
my dinner and was smoking a cigar when a servant
brought me word that a man was waiting to see me below.
When I went into the hall I saw a figure standing by
the door, holding his hat in his hands. In the dim light
I could not make out his face and asked him to step
into the library, where I turned on the light. It was the
preacher Hardman.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" I asked in some surprise.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought not to trouble you here at this
hour, Mr. Harrington," he said timidly. "But I am
much worried. You remember that investment you were
kind enough to make for me a few years ago?"</p>

<p>His question recalled to my mind the fact that he had
given me a little inheritance which had come to his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
asking me to invest it for him. I had put it into some
construction bonds.</p>

<p>"What about it?" I asked.</p>

<p>He stammered out his story. Some one had told him
that I was in a bad shape; he had also read a piece in the
paper about the road, and he had become scared. It
had not occurred to him to sell his bonds before he
preached that little sermon at me; but, now that my sins
were apparently about to overtake me, he wished to save
his little property from destruction.</p>

<p>"Why don't you sell?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have tried to," he admitted, "but the price offered
me is very low."</p>

<p>I laughed at the fellow's simple egotism.</p>

<p>"So you thought I might take your bonds off your
hands? Got them there?"</p>

<p>"My wife thought, as your&mdash;" he stammered. I
waived his excuse aside.</p>

<p>He drew the bonds from his coat pocket. As I sat
down to write a check I said jokingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better hustle round to the bank to-morrow and get
your cash."</p>

<p>"I trust you are not seriously incommoded by this
panic," he remarked inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Gold's the thing these days!" I laughed.</p>

<p>(The cashier at the bank told me afterward that Hardman
made such a fuss when he went to cash his check
that they actually had to hand him out six thousand dollars
in gold coin.)</p>

<p>The preacher man had no more than crawled out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
profuse words of thanks than I had another caller. This
time it was a young doctor of my acquaintance. He
was trying to put on an indifferent air, as if he had
been used to financial crises all his life. He had his
doubts in his eyes, however, and I took him into my
confidence.</p>

<p>"If you possibly can, stick to what you have got. It
may take a long time for prices to get back to the right
place, but this tumble is only temporary. Have faith&mdash;faith
in your judgment, faith in your country!"</p>

<p>I knew something of his story, of the hard fight he
had made to get his education, of his marriage and his
wife's sickness, with success always put off into the future.
He had brought me his scrapings and savings,
and I had made the most of them.</p>

<p>When at last the doctor had gone away somewhat reassured,
I sat down to think. There were a good many
others like these two&mdash;little people or well-to-do, who
had put their faith in me and had trusted their money
to my enterprises. Not much, each one; but in every
case a cruel sum to lose. They had brought me their
savings, their legacies, because they knew me or had
heard that I had made money rapidly. Could I leave
them now?</p>

<p class="caption"><i>It was a messenger boy

</div>

<p>I might be willing to go off to Cuba and see my own
fortune fade into smoke. But how about their money?
No&mdash;it was not a simple thing just to go broke by one's
self. To-morrow my office would be crowded by these
followers, and there would be letters and telegrams from
those who couldn't get there. So back to the old prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>lem!
I rested my head on my hands and went over
in my mind the situation, the
amount of my loans, the eternal
question of credit&mdash;where to get
a handhold to stay me while the
whirlwind passed, as I knew it
must pass.</p>

<p>Hour after hour I wrestled with
myself. Ordinarily I could close
my eyes on any danger and get
the sleep that Nature owes every
hard-working sinner. But not
to-night. I sat with my hands
locked, thinking. Along about
midnight there sounded in the
silent house a ring at the door-bell:
it was a messenger boy with a delayed
telegram. I tore it open
and read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remember my letter." It was
dated from Washington, and was
not signed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="chap">THE LAST DITCH</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Romantic folly&mdash;The impulse that comes from beyond our sight&mdash;I
go to seek Mr. Carboner&mdash;An unpromising location for a
banker&mdash;I receive advice and help&mdash;Dickie Pierson gets an
order from me&mdash;What is Strauss's game?</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The yellow paper lay in my hand, and, with a flash, my
memory went back to that mysterious note which Jane
Dround had sent on the eve of her departure for Europe.
It lay undisturbed in a drawer of my office desk. I smiled
impatiently at the woman's folly&mdash;of the letter, the telegram.
And yet it warmed my heart that she should be
thinking of me this day, that she should divine my
troubles. And I seemed to see her dark eyebrows arched
with scorn at my weakness, her thin lips curl disdainfully,
as if to say: "Was this to be your finish? Have I
helped you, believed in you, all these years, to have you
fall now?" So she had spoken.</p>

<p>But still I was unconvinced, and in this state of mind
I went back to bed, knowing that I should need on the
morrow what sleep I could get. But sleep did not come:
instead, my mind busied itself with Jane Dround's letter&mdash;with
the woman herself. As the night grew toward
morning I arose, dressed myself, and left the house. The
letter in my office pulled me like a thread of fate; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
obeyed its call like a child. In the lightening dawn I
hurried through the streets to the lofty building where
the Products Company had its offices, and groped my way
up the long flights of stairs. As I sat down at my desk
and unlocked the drawers, the morning sun shot in from
the lake over the smoky buildings beneath me. After
some hunting I found the letter. Mrs. Dround wrote a
peculiar hand&mdash;firm, clear, unchangeable, but with curious
tiny flourishes about the <i>r</i>'s and <i>s</i>'s.</p>

<p>As I glanced at it, the woman herself rose before my
eyes, and she sat across the desk from me, looking into
my face. "Yes, I need you," I found myself muttering;
"not any letter, but <i>you</i>, with your will and your
courage, now, if ever. For this is the last ditch, sure
enough!"</p>

<p>The letter shook in my hand and beat against the
desk. It was a silly thing to leave my bed and come
chasing down here at five in the morning to get hold
of a romantic woman's letter! My nerves were wrong.
Something in me revolted from going any further with
this weakness, and I still hesitated to tear open the envelope.
The other battles of my life I had won unaided.</p>

<p>At the bottom of our hearts there is a feeling which
we do not understand, a respect for the unknown. Terror,
fear,&mdash;call it what you will,&mdash;sometime in life every one
is made to feel it. All my life has been given to practical
facts, yet I know that at the end of all things there
are no facts. In the silence and gray light of that morning
I felt the strong presence of my friend, holding out
to me a hand.... I tore open the letter. Inside was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
another little envelope, which contained a visiting-card.
On it was written: "Mr. J. Carboner, 230 West Lake
Street," and beneath, in fine script, this one sentence:
"<i>Mr. Carboner is a good adviser&mdash;see him!</i>"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i289" id="i289"></a>
<img src="images/i289.jpg" width="390" height="565" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>For this is the last ditch, sure enough!</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>This was fit pay for my folly. Of all the sentimental
nonsense, an adviser! What was wanted was better
than a million dollars of ready cash&mdash;within three
hours. It was now half-past six o'clock, and I had
left until half-past nine to find an ordinary, practical
way out of my present difficulties. Then the banks
would be open; the great wheel of business would begin
to revolve, with its sure, merciless motion. Nevertheless,
in spite of my scepticism, my eyes wandered to
a map of the city that hung on the wall, and I made
out the location of the address given on the card. It
was a bare half-mile across the roofs from where I sat,
in a quarter of the city lying along the river, given
up to brick warehouses, factories, and freight yards.
Small likelihood that a man with a million to spare in
his pocket was to be found over there!</p>

<p>In this mood of depression and disgust I left my
office, to get shaved. "Street floor, sir," the elevator boy
called out to wake me from my preoccupation. As I stood
on the curb in the same will-less daze, a cab came prowling
down the street, crossed to my side, and the disreputable-looking
driver touched his dirty hat with his
whip:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cab, sir?"</p>

<p>"Two-thirty West Lake," I said to him mechanically,
and plunged into his carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>The cab finally drew up beside a low, grimy brick
building that looked as if it might have survived the
fire. There was a flight of dirty stairs leading from the
street to the office floor, and over the small, old-fashioned
windows a faded sign read "Jules Carboner." In response
to my knock an old man opened the locked door
a crack and looked out at me. When I asked to see Mr.
Carboner, he admitted me suspiciously to a little room,
which was divided in two by a high iron screen. On the
inner side of the screen there was a battered desk, a few
chairs, and a row of leather-backed folios that might
have been in use since the founding of the city. A small
coal fire was burning dully in the grate. As I stood
waiting for Mr. Carboner, a barge laden with lumber cast
its shadow through the dirty windows....</p>

<p>"And what may you want of me?"</p>

<p>The words were uttered like a cough. The one who
spoke them had entered the inner office so noiselessly that
I had not heard him. He had a white head of hair,
and jet-black eyes. I handed him my card with Mrs.
Dround's note.</p>

<p>"I was expecting you," the old gentleman remarked,
glancing indifferently at my card. He unlocked the door
of the iron grating and held it open, pointing to a chair
in front of the fire. Mr. Carboner was short and round,
with swarthy, full-blooded cheeks. Evidently he was
some sort of foreigner, but I could not place him among
the types of men I knew.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" he demanded briskly.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a lot of money, first and last!" I laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>This announcement didn't seem to trouble him; he
waited for my explanation. And remembering that I
was to look to him for advice as well as cash, I proceeded
to explain briefly the situation that I found
myself in. He listened without comment.</p>

<p>"Finally," I said rather wearily, "just now, when I
am in deep water with this railroad and all the rest, and
the banks calling my loans, some fellows are selling their
Meat Products stock. It will all go to my enemies&mdash;to
Strauss and his crowd, and I shall find myself presently
kicked out of the company. I suppose it's Mr. Dround's
stock that's coming on the market. It's like him to sell
when prices are going down."</p>

<p>The little old fellow shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is not Mr. Dround's stock," he said. "Most of
that is over there." He nodded his head in the direction
of a small safe which stood in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>"How did you get it?" I exclaimed in my astonishment,
jumping to my feet.</p>

<p>"Never mind how&mdash;we have had it three months," he
replied with a smile. "You need not fear that it will
come on the market just now."</p>

<p>My heart gave a great bound upward: with this block
of stock locked up I could do what I would with Meat
Products. Strauss could never put his hands on it.
Jane Dround must have worked this stroke; but how she
did it was a mystery. I walked back and forth in my
excitement, and when I sat down once more Mr. Carboner
began a neat little summary of my situation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are engaged in many ventures.  Some are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
strong." He named all the good ones as if he were quoting
from a carefully drawn report. "Some are weak."
He named the others. "Now, you are trying to hold the
weak with the strong. It is like carrying a basket of
eggs on your head. All goes well until some one runs
against you. Then bum, biff!&mdash;you have the beginning
of an omelet."</p>

<p>His way of putting it made me laugh.</p>

<p>"And the omelet is about ready to cook in an hour or
two!" I added.</p>

<p>"We shall see presently. You want to sell out this
packing business, some day, eh? To Strauss? You take
big chances. You are a new man. They suspect you.
They call your loans. They think that you are thin in
the waist? You have to borrow a great deal of money
and pay high for it?"</p>

<p>"You have sized me up, Mr. Carboner."</p>

<p>"And after you have sold to Strauss there will be railroads&mdash;ah,
that is more difficult! And then many other
things&mdash;always ventures, risks, schemes, plans, great
plans! For you are very bold."</p>

<p>"Well, what will you do for me?" I asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"I think we can carry you over this river, Mr. Harrington,"
he replied, looking at me with a very amiable air,
as if he were my schoolmaster and had decided to give
me a holiday and some spending money. Who made up
the "we" in this firm of Rip Van Winkle bankers?
Carboner seemed to divine my doubts; for he smiled as
he reached for a pad of paper and began to write in a
close, crabbed hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take that to Mr. Bates," he directed. "You know
him, eh?"</p>

<p>Did I know Orlando Bates! If I had been to him once
at the Tenth National, of which he was president, I had
been to him fifty times, with varying results. I knew
every wrinkle in his parchment-covered face.</p>

<p>"He will give you what you want," the old man
added.</p>

<p>I still hesitated, holding Carboner's scrawl in my
hand.</p>

<p>"You think it no good?" He motioned to the sheet
of coarse paper. "Try it!"</p>

<p>"Don't you want a receipt?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"What for? Do you think I am a pawnbroker?"</p>

<p>The mystery grew. Suppose I should take this old
fellow's scrawl over to Orlando Bates, and the president
of the Tenth National should ask me what it meant?</p>

<p>"It is good," Carboner said impressively.</p>

<p>"Whose is it?" The words escaped me unconsciously.
"I want to know whose money I am taking."</p>

<p>"I hope it will be no one's," he answered imperturbably,
"except the bank's. You come to me wanting money,
credit. I give it to you. I ask no questions. Why should
you?"</p>

<p>Was it a woman's money I was taking to play out my
game. I recalled the story Sarah had told me years
ago about Jane Dround's father and his fortune. He
was a rich old half-breed trader, and it was gossiped that
he had left behind him a pile of gold. Perhaps this Mr.
Carboner was some French-Canadian, friend or business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
partner of Jane's father, who had charge of her affairs.
As Sarah had said, Jane Dround was always secret and
uncommunicative about herself. My faith in the piece
of paper was growing, but I still waited.</p>

<p>"If you lay these matters down now," Carboner observed
coldly, poking the fire with an old pair of tongs,
"they will be glass. If you grasp them in a strong hand,
they will become diamonds."</p>

<p class="caption">"<i>If you grasp them in a strong hand, they will become diamonds.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>But to take a woman's money! I thought for a moment&mdash;and
then dismissed the scruple as swiftly as it
had come. This woman was a good gambler!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right!" I exclaimed, drawing on my overcoat,
which I had laid aside.</p>

<p>"Good! Don't worry about anything. Make your
trees bear fruit. That is what you can do, young man."
Old Carboner patted me on the back in a fatherly fashion.
"Now we will have some coffee together. There is yet
time."</p>

<p>The man who had opened the door for me brought in
two cups of strong coffee, and I drank mine standing
while Carboner sipped his and talked.</p>

<p>"This disturbance will be over soon," he said sagely.
"Then we shall have such times of wealth and speculation
as the world has never seen. Great things will be
done in a few years, and you will do some of them.
There are those who have confidence in you, my son.
And confidence is worth many millions in gold."</p>

<p>He gave me his hand in dismissal.</p>

<p>"Come to see me again, and we will talk," he added
sociably.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the ground floor of my building there was a broker's
office. It was a new firm of young men, without much
backing. My old friend, Dickie Pierson, was one of
them, and on his account I had given the firm some business
now and then. This morning, as I was hurrying
back to my office, I ran into Dick standing in the door
of his place. He beckoned me into the room where
the New York quotations were beginning to go up on
the board. He pointed to the local list of the day
before; Meat Products stretched in a long string of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
quotations across the board, mute evidence of yesterday's
slaughter.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with your concern?" Dick asked
anxiously. "Some one is pounding it for all he is
worth."</p>

<p>"Who were selling yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Stearns &amp; Harris," he answered. (They were brokers
that Strauss's crowd were known to use.)</p>

<p>There was a mystery here somewhere. For there
could not be any considerable amount of the stock loose,
now that Dround's block was locked up in Jules Carboner's
safe. Yet did the Strauss crowd dare to sell it
short in this brazen way? They must think it would be
cheap enough soon, or they knew where they could get
some stock when they wanted it.</p>

<p>"What's up?" Dick asked again, hovering at my
elbow. I judged that he had gone into Meat Products
on his own account, and wanted to know which way to
jump.</p>

<p>"It looks bad for us," I said confidentially to Dickie.
"You needn't publish this on the street." (I reckoned
that the tip would be on the ticker before noon.) "But
Dround has gone over to the other crowd. And probably
some of our people are squeezed just now so they can't
hold their Meat Products." I added some yarn about a
lawsuit to make doubly sure of Dickie, and ordered him
to sell a few hundred shares on my own account as a
clincher.</p>

<p>When I reached my telephone I called up some brokers
that I trusted and told them to watch the market for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Meat Products stock, and pick it up quietly, leading on
the gang that was pounding our issues all they could.
An hour later, on my way back from the Tenth National,
where I had had a most satisfactory interview with Mr.
Orlando Bates, I dropped in at Dickie Pierson's place.
Meat Products shares were active, and in full retreat
across the broad board.</p>

<p>"I guess you had better sell some more for me," I said
to Dickie. "Sell a thousand to-morrow."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="chap">VICTORY</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The shorts are caught&mdash;Big John comes to my office to get terms&mdash;An
exchange of opinions&mdash;An alliance proposed&mdash;I reject it&mdash;My
enemies are flattering&mdash;I have arrived</i></p></blockquote>


<p>They sent old John Carmichael around to treat with
me. He had to come to the office the same as any other
man who had a favor to ask. Slocum and I and two or
three others who were close to us were there waiting for
him, and discussing the terms we should give.</p>

<p>"They must be short in the neighborhood of fifteen
thousand shares common and preferred the best we can
make out," Slocum reported, after conferring with our
brokers. "How did you have the nerve, Van, to run
this corner when you knew Dround's stock was loose?"</p>

<p>"It isn't loose," I answered.</p>

<p>"Where is it, then? We know pretty well where
every other share is, but his block has dropped out of
the market. It was transferred to some New York
parties last October."</p>

<p>I smiled tranquilly. There had been no leak in our
barrel. Slocum and I had been around to all the other
large holders of Meat Products, and I knew they would
not go back on us. The Strauss crowd would find the
corner invulnerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>When Carmichael came in he nodded to me familiarly,
just as he used to at Dround's when he had been away
on a trip to New York or some place, and called out
gruffly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say! I told them you were a bad one to go up against.
Say, Harrington, do you remember how you scalped poor
old McGee back in the days when you were doing odd
jobs at Dround's? Well, I came over here to see what
you want for your old sausage shop, anyway."</p>

<p>With that gibe at my start in the packing business he
settled back in his chair and pulled out a cigar.</p>

<p>"I don't know that we are anxious to sell, John," I
replied.</p>

<p>"What? That talk don't go. I know you want to
get out mighty bad. What's your figure?"</p>

<p>"You fellows have given us a lot of trouble, first and
last," I mused tranquilly. "There was that injunction
business over the London and Chicago Company, and the
squeeze by the banks. You have tried every dirty little
game you knew."</p>

<p>Carmichael grinned and smoked.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want our outfit to turn out some
more rotten canned stuff for the Government. What you
sold them isn't fit for a Chinaman to eat, John." Thereupon
I reached into a drawer of my desk and brought out
a tin of army beef marked with the well-known brand
of the great Strauss. I proceeded to open it, and as soon
as the cover was removed a foul odor offended our nostrils.
"Here's a choice specimen one of our boys got for me."</p>

<p>Carmichael smoked on placidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is something we have never done, though we
couldn't make anything on our contract at the figures
you people set. And little of the business we got, anyway!
Strauss ought to be put where he'd have to feed
off his own rations."</p>

<p>So we sat and scored one another comfortably for a
time, and then came to business. The terms that Slocum
and I had figured out were that Strauss and his crowd
should pay us in round numbers two hundred dollars per
share preferred and common alike, allowing every shareholder
the same terms. Carmichael leaped to his feet
when he heard the figures.</p>

<p>"You're crazy mad, Van," he swore volubly. Then he
stated his plan, which was, in brief, that we should make
an alliance with the great Strauss and sell him at
"reasonable figures" an interest in our company.</p>

<p>"And let you and Strauss freeze out my friends?
Not for one minute! Go back and tell your boss to find
that stock he's short of."</p>

<p>Carmichael threw us an amused glance.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's worrying us? If you want a
fight, I guess we can give you some trouble."</p>

<p>It seems that they had another club behind their backs,
and that was a suit, which they were instigating the
Attorney-general to bring against the Meat Products
Company for infringing the Illinois anti-trust act. The
impudence and boldness of this suggestion angered me.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "You have our figure, John."</p>

<p>He left us that day, but he came the next morning
with new proposals from his master. They were anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to have a peaceable settlement. I had known for some
time that these men were preparing for an astonishing
move, which was nothing less than a gigantic combination
of all the large food-product industries of the country,
and they could not leave us as a thorn in their side.
They must annex us, cost what it might.</p>

<p>So now they talked of my ability, of what I had done
in making a great business out of a lot of remnants,
and they wanted to buy me as well as our company,
offering me some strong inducements to join them. But
I told Carmichael shortly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will never work with Strauss in this life. It's
no use your talking, John. There isn't enough money
coined to bring me to him. You must buy our stock
outright&mdash;and be quick about it, too."</p>

<p>He could not understand my feeling, and it was not
reasonable. But all these years of desperate fight there
had grown up in my heart a hatred of my enemy beyond
the usual cold passions of business. I hated him as a
machine, as a man,&mdash;as a cruel, treacherous, selfish, unpatriotic
maker of dollars.</p>

<p>So in the end they came to my terms, and the lawyers
set to work on the papers. The Strauss interests were
to take over the Meat Products stock at our figure,
and also the Empress Line, our private-car enterprise,
and two or three smaller matters that had grown up in
connection with the packing business. When Slocum
and I went on to New York to finish the transaction,
Sarah and the girls accompanied us, on their way to
Europe, where they were going for a pleasure trip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">"<i>There isn't enough money coined to bring me to him.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>Thus in a few months my labors came to flower, and
suddenly the map of my life changed completely. The
end was not yet, but no longer was I the needy adventurer
besieging men of means to join me in my enterprises,
dodging daily blows in a hand-to-hand scrimmage&mdash;a
struggling packer! I had brought Strauss to my own
terms. And when the proud firm of Morris Brothers,
the great bankers, invited me to confer with them in
regard to our railroad properties in the Southwest, and
to take part in one of those deals which in a day transform
the industrial map of the country, I felt that I
had come out upon the level plateau of power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="chap">DOUBTS</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The time of jubilation&mdash;At the bankers'&mdash;The last word from
Farson&mdash;Sarah and I go to see the parade&mdash;We meet the
Drounds&mdash;A fading life&mdash;Sad thoughts&mdash;Jane speaks out&mdash;What
next?&mdash;Sarah is no longer jealous</i></p></blockquote>


<p>It was that autumn of jubilation after the Spanish
War. The morning when I drove through the city to
the bankers' office, workmen were putting up a great arch
across the avenue for the coming day of celebration.
Our people had shown the nations of the world the might
and the glory in us. Forgotten now was the miserable
mismanagement of our brave men, the shame of rotten
rations, the fraud of politicians&mdash;all but the pride of our
strength! A new spirit had come over our country during
these months&mdash;a spirit of daring and adventure, of readiness
for vast enterprises. That business world of which
I was a part was boiling with activities. The great
things that had been done in the past in the light of the
present seemed but the deeds of babes. And every man
who had his touch upon affairs felt the madness of the
times.</p>

<p>Among the gentlemen gathered in the bankers' office
that morning was my old friend Farson. I had not seen
him since our unpleasant luncheon at the railroad station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
He greeted me courteously enough, as if he had once been
acquainted with somebody by my name. It was apparent
that he had come there to represent what was left of the
old New England interests in the railroad properties; but
he did not count in that gathering. The men at Morris
Brothers listened to me most of the time that morning!</p>

<p>As we broke up for luncheon Farson congratulated me
dryly on the success I had met with in the negotiations.</p>

<p>"I hope, then, we shall have your support," I remarked,
forgetting our past dispute.</p>

<p>"I am here to see that my friends are taken care of,"
he replied grimly; "all we hope is to get our money back
from the properties. My people do not understand you
and your generation. We are better apart."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you think so," I said, understanding well
enough what he meant.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, too: sorry for you and for our country in
the years to come. For she it is who suffers most by
such ideals as you stand for."</p>

<p>"I think that you are mistaken there," I answered
peaceably. "We are the ones who are making this
country great. If it weren't for men like me, you good
people wouldn't be doing any business to speak of.
There wouldn't be much to be done!"</p>

<p>"Our fathers found enough to do," he retorted dryly,
"and they did not buy judges nor maintain lobbies in the
legislature."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any money in it those days!" I laughed.</p>

<p>Talking thus we reached the place where I was to lunch
with some others, and I asked him to join the party.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
The uncompromising old duck refused; he wouldn't even
break bread with me at a hotel table.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you won't eat with me, Mr. Farson. I
don't hope to convert you to my way of thinking and
feeling. But you were good to me and saved my life
when I was in a tight place, and I am glad to think that
no loss ever came to you or your friends through me.
I have made money for you all. And I wish you would
stay with me and let me make a lot more for you in this
new deal we are putting through."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said with a dry little smile, "but I and
my friends will be content with getting back the money
we have spent. Mr. Harrington, there is one thing that
you Western gentlemen&mdash;no! it is unfair to cast that
slur on one section of the country, and I have met
honorable gentlemen West as well as East&mdash;but there
is one thing that you gentlemen of finance to-day fail
to understand&mdash;there is always a greater rascal than
any one of you somewhere, and it is usually only a question
of time when you will meet him. When that time
comes he will pick the flesh from your bones, and no one
will care very much what happens to you then! And one
thing more: to one who has lived life, and knows what
it is, there is mighty little happiness in a million dollars!
Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>He was a lovable old fool, though! All through luncheon
and the business talk that followed in the afternoon
the old gentleman's remarks kept coming back to me in
a queer, persistent way. Feeling my oats as I did, in
the full flood of my success, there was yet something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
unsatisfied about my heart. My brain was busy with the
plans of the Morris Brothers, but nothing more.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After the work of the day was over, Sarah and I drove
up to the Park to see the parade of fine horses and
carriages and smart-looking folks who were out taking
their airing. It was a beautiful, warm October day, and
Sarah took considerable interest in the show. The faces
of those in the carriages were not much to look at, take
them by and large. They were the faces of men and
women who ate and drank and enjoyed themselves too
much. They were the faces of the people who lived in
the rich hotels, who made and spent the money of our
country. And as I looked at them, Farson's last words
came back to my thoughts:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's mighty little happiness in a million dollars."</p>

<p>"Van," Sarah said after a time, "let us drive over the
avenue. I want to look at that house the Rainbows spoke
to us about."</p>

<p>So we turned out of the Park toward the house on the
avenue which we thought of buying; for we had been
talking somewhat of moving to New York to live after
this year.</p>

<p>As we got out of our carriage in front of the lofty
gray stone house, a man and a woman came toward us on
the walk. The man seemed old and moved heavily, and
the woman's face was bent to one side to him. Sarah
glanced at them and stood still.</p>

<p>"Van," she whispered, "there are Mr. and Mrs.
Dround!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and then, as the two came
nearer, she stepped forward to meet them, and Jane
looked up at us. The two women glanced at each
other, then spoke. Mrs. Dround said something to her
husband, and he gave me a slow look of returning
recognition, as if my face recalled vague memories.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harrington?" he said questioningly, taking my
hand in a hesitating way, as though he were not quite
sure about me yet. "Oh, yes! I am glad to see you
again. How is Mr. Carmichael? Well, I hope, and
prospering?"</p>

<p>The man's mind was a blank!</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Dround and I have been abroad this
winter," he continued, "but we have come back to live
here. America is the proper place for Americans, I have
always believed. I have no patience with those people
who expatriate themselves. Yes, Mrs. Dround wanted
me to take a place in Kent, but I would not listen to it.
I know where my duty lies,"&mdash;he straightened himself
with slow pompousness,&mdash;"How are the children? All
well, I hope?"</p>

<p>Jane was talking with Sarah, and the four of us after
a while entered the house, which was just being finished
by the contractor. In the hall Mr. Dround turned to
Sarah and made some remark about the house, and the
agent, who happened to be there, led them upstairs.
Jane and I followed.</p>

<p>"So you have come home to live?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" She sank down on a workman's bench, with
a sigh of weariness. As I looked at her more closely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
it seemed to me that at last age had touched her.
There were white strands in her black hair, and there
were deep circles beneath the dark eyes&mdash;eyes that
were dull from looking without seeing anything in
particular.</p>

<p>"It was best for Henry," she added quietly. "He is
restless over there. You see, he forgets everything so
quickly now. It has been so for nearly a year."</p>

<p>There was the story of her days&mdash;the watcher and
keeper of this childish man, whose mind was fading
away before its time. With a sense of the cruelty in it,
I turned away from her hastily and looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>"I do not mind, most times," she said gently, as in
answer to my action. "It is easier to bear than some
things of life."</p>

<p>"Shame!" I muttered.</p>

<p>"But there are days," she burst out more like her old
self, "when I simply cannot stand it! But let us not
waste these precious minutes with my troubles. Let us
talk of <i>you</i>. You are still young in spite of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The gray hair and the two hundred and forty
pounds? I don't feel so young as I might, Jane!"</p>

<p>She colored at the sound of her name.</p>

<p>"But you have got much for your gray hairs&mdash;you
have lived more than most men!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," I demanded suddenly,&mdash;"I know it was
your hand that pulled me from the last hole. It was
your money that Carboner risked? I knew it. Old
Carboner wouldn't tell, but I knew it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you were on the point of refusing my help," she
added with an accusing smile. "I should have scorned
you, if you had gone away without it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't hesitate long! And I am glad now it
was yours, in more ways than one," I added quickly.
"It was a profitable deal,&mdash;Carboner wrote you the
terms?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it would have made no difference if it had
come out badly&mdash;you can't know what it meant to me
to do that! To work with you with all my strength! It
was the first real joy I ever got from my money, and
perhaps the last, too. For you are beyond my help
now."</p>

<p>"How did Carboner get hold of your husband's
stock?" I persisted curiously.</p>

<p>"That is my secret!" she smiled back with a look of
her old self. "Why should you want to know? That
is so like a man! Always wanting to know why.
Believe in the fairies for once!"</p>

<p>"It was a mighty clever fairy this time. She had lots
of power. Do you see that, after all, in spite of all
the talk about genius and destiny and being self-made
and all that, I did not win the game by myself? I
would have been broke now, a discredited gambler, if it
hadn't been for your helping hand. It was you! And
I guess, Jane, we all have to have some help."</p>

<p>"You don't begrudge me the little help I gave you&mdash;the
small share I had in your fortune?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind. I am glad of it."</p>

<p>That was sincere enough. I had come to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
no man can stand alone, and I was not ashamed to have
taken my help from the hand of a woman.</p>

<p>"But suppose I had gambled with your money and
lost it? I might have easily enough."</p>

<p>"Do you think I should have cared?"</p>

<p>"No, Jane, I guess not. But I should have!"</p>

<p>"It's been the joy of these terrible years, knowing that
you were here in the world accomplishing what you were
born to do! And that I had a little&mdash;oh, such a little!&mdash;share
in helping you do it. Poor I, who have never
done anything worth while!"</p>

<p>"It seems queer that a woman should set so much
store on what a man does."</p>

<p>"It's beyond a man's power to know that! But try to
think what you would be if you were a helpless cripple,
tied to your chair. Don't you suppose that when some
strong, handsome athlete came your way with all his
health, you would admire him, get interested in him,
and like to watch those muscles at work, just the muscles
you couldn't use? I think so. And if a good fate put
it in your power to help him&mdash;you, the poor cripple in
your chair&mdash;help him to win his race, wouldn't you be
thankful? I can tell you that one cripple blesses you
because you are you&mdash;a man!"</p>

<p>The excitement of her feelings brought back the dark
glow to her face, and made her beautiful once more.
Ideas seemed to burn away the faded look and gave her
the power that passion gives ordinary women.</p>

<p>"You and I think alike, I love to believe. Start us
from the two Poles, and we would meet midway. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
are not little people, thank God, you and I. We did not
make a mess of our lives! My friend, it is good to know
that," she ended softly.</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted, understanding what she meant.
"We parted."</p>

<p>"We parted! We lived a thousand miles from one
another. What matters it? I said to myself each day:
'Out there, in the world, lives a man who thinks and
acts and feels as I would have a man think and act
and feel. He is not far away.'"</p>

<p>She laid a hand lightly on my arm and smiled. And
we were silent until the voices of the others in the hall
above reminded us of the present. Jane rose, and her
face had faded once more into its usual calm.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of moving to New York? What
for?"</p>

<p>I spoke of my new work&mdash;the checker-board that had
been under discussion all day at the bankers'.</p>

<p>"You are rich enough," she remarked. "That means
so many millions more to your account."</p>

<p>"No, not just that," I protested. "It's the solution to
the little puzzle you and I were working at over the atlas
in your library that day years ago. It is like a problem in
human physics: there were obstacles in the way, but the
result was sure from the start."</p>

<p>"But you are near the end of it&mdash;and then what?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there will be others!" After a time I
added, half to myself: "But there's no happiness in it.
There is no happiness."</p>

<p>"Do you look for happiness? That is for children!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what is the end of it?"</p>

<p>For of a sudden the spring of my energies was
slackened within me, and the work that I was doing
seemed senseless. Somehow a man's happiness had
slipped past me on the road, and now I missed it. There
was the joy we might have had, she and I, and we had
not taken it. Had we been fools to put it aside? She
answered my thoughts.</p>

<p>"We did not want it! Remember we did not want
that! Don't let me think that, after all, you regret! I
could not stand that&mdash;no woman could bear it."</p>

<p>Her voice was like a cry to my soul. On the stairs
above Mr. Dround was saying to Sarah:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I much prefer our Chicago style of building, with
large lots, where you can get sunshine on all four sides.
It is more healthy, don't you think, Mrs. Harrington?"</p>

<p>And Sarah answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite agree with you, Mr. Dround. I don't
like this house at all&mdash;it's too dark. We shall have
to look farther, I guess."</p>

<p>Jane turned her face to mine. Her eyes were filled
with tears, and her mouth trembled. "Don't regret&mdash;anything,"
she whispered. "We have had so much!"</p>

<p>"Van," Sarah called from the stairs, "you haven't
seen the house! But it isn't worth while. I am sure
we shouldn't like it."</p>

<p>"You mustn't look for your Chicago garden on Fifth
Avenue," Mrs. Dround laughed.</p>

<p>As we left the house, Sarah turned to Jane and asked
her to come back with us to the hotel for dinner. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the Drounds had an engagement for the evening, and so
an appointment was made for the day following to dine
together. When we had said good-by and were in the
carriage, Sarah remarked reflectively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jane looks like an old woman&mdash;don't you think so,
Van?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">A NEW AMBITION</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>Jane Dround points the way again&mdash;The shoes of Parkinson and
the senatorial toga&mdash;Strauss is dead&mdash;Business or politics?&mdash;A
dream of wealth&mdash;The family sail for Europe</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"I am writing Sarah that after all we cannot dine
with you. My husband is restless and feels that we
must leave for the West to-night. It was very sweet of
Sarah to want us, but after all perhaps it is just as well.
We shall see you both soon, I am sure....</p>

<p>"But there is something I want to say to you&mdash;something
that has been on my mind all the long hours since
our meeting. Those brief moments yesterday I felt that
all was not well with you, my friend. Your eyes had a
restless demand that I never saw in them before. I suspect
that you are beginning to know that Success is nothing
but a mirage, fading before our eyes from stage to stage.
You have accomplished all and more than you planned
that afternoon when we hung over the atlas together.
You are rich now, very rich. You are a Power in the
world,&mdash;yes, you are,&mdash;not yet a very great planet,
but one that is rapidly swinging higher into the zenith.
You must be reckoned with! My good Jules keeps me
informed, you see. If you keep your hold in these
new enterprises, you will double your fortune many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
times, and before long you will be one of the masters&mdash;one
of the little group who really control our times,
our country. Yet&mdash;I wonder&mdash;yes, my doubt has
grown so large since I saw you that it moves me to
write all this.... Will <i>that</i> be enough? Mere wealth,
mere power of that kind, will it satisfy?... It is hard
enough to tell what <i>will satisfy</i>; but there are other
things&mdash;other worlds than your world of money power.
But I take your time with my woman's nonsense&mdash;forgive
me!</p>

<p>"I hear from a good authority in Washington that our
old Senator Parkinson is really on his last legs. That illness
of his this spring, which they tried to keep quiet,
was really a stroke, and it will be a miracle if he lasts
another winter. Did you know him? He was a queer
old farmer sort of politician. His successor, I fancy,
will be some one quite different. That type of statesman
has had its day! <i>There</i> is a career, now, if a man
wanted it!... Why not think of it?</p>

<p>"Good-by, my friend. I had almost forgotten, as I forgot
yesterday, to thank you for making me so rich! Mr.
Carboner cabled me the terms of your settlement with
Strauss.  They were wicked!</p>

<p class="deepind pb">
"<span class="smcap">Jane Dround.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"It would not be the most difficult thing in the world
to capture Parkinson's seat&mdash;if one were willing to pay
the price!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The idea of slipping into old Parkinson's shoes made
me laugh. It was a bit of feminine extravagance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Nevertheless this letter gave me food for thought. Jane
was right enough in saying that my wonderful success
had not brought me all the satisfaction that it should.
Now that the problems I had labored over were working
themselves out to the plain solution of dollars and cents,
the zest of the matter was oozing away. To be sure,
there was prospect of some excitement to be had in the
railroad enterprises of the Morris Brothers, although it
was merest flattery to say that my position counted for
much as yet in that mighty game. Did I want to make
it count?</p>

<p>I sipped my morning coffee and listened to Sarah's
talk. Beyond business, what was there for me? There
was our place down in Vermilion County, Illinois. But
stock-farming was an old man's recreation. I might become
a collector like Mr. Dround, roaming about Europe,
buying old stuff to put in a house or give to a museum.
But I was too ignorant for that kind of play. And philanthropy?
Well, in time, perhaps when I knew what was
best to give folks, which isn't as simple as it might seem.</p>

<p>"I am sorry the Drounds couldn't come," Sarah was
saying, glancing at Jane's note to her. "I liked Jane
better yesterday than ever before&mdash;she looked so worn
and kind of miserable. I don't believe she can be
happy, Van."</p>

<p>"Well, she didn't say so!" I replied....</p>

<p>Yes, I knew Senator Parkinson&mdash;a sly, tricky politician,
for all his simple farmer ways. He was not what
is called a railroad Senator, but the railroads never had
much trouble with him....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>Before we had finished our breakfast Carmichael sent
up word that he must see me, and I hurried down to the
lobby of the hotel. He met me at the elevator and drew
me aside, saying abruptly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The old man is dead! Just got a wire from Chicago&mdash;apoplexy.
I must get back there at once."</p>

<p>Strauss dead! The news did not come home to me all
at once. His was not just like any other death. From
the day when the old packer had first come within my
sight he had loomed big and savage on my horizon, and
around him, somehow, my life had revolved for years.
I hated him. I hated his tricky, wolfish ways, his hog-it-all
policy; I despised his mean, unpatriotic character.
Yet his going was like the breaking of some great wheel
at the centre of industry.</p>

<p>I had hated him, and for that reason I had refused all
offers to settle on anything but a cash basis for my
interests in the companies he was buying from us. Carmichael
and some others had urged me again and again
to go in with them and help them build the great merger,
but I had steadily refused to work with Strauss. "I
cannot make a good servant," I had said to John, "and I
don't want a knife in my side. The country is big enough
for Strauss and me. I'll give him his side of the pasture."</p>

<p>But now he was dead, and already, somehow, my hate
was fading from my heart. The great Strauss was but
another man like myself, who had done his work in his
own way. Carmichael, who was a good deal worked up,
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This won't make any hitch in our negotiations, Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>rington.
Everything will go right on just as before.
The old man's plans were laid pretty deep, and this deal
with you is one of the first of them. His brother Joe
will take his place, maybe, and if he can't fill the shoes,
why, young Jenks, who seems to be a smart young man,
or I will take the reins."</p>

<p>(Old Strauss had been married three times, but his
children had all died. There was no one of his own
to take the ball of money he had made and roll it larger;
no one of his own blood to grasp the reins of his power
and drive on in the old man's way!)</p>

<p>"Say, Van," the Irishman continued, "why don't you
think it over once more, and see your way to join us?
You didn't care for the old man. But you and I and
Jenks could swing things all right. And we could keep
Joe Strauss in his place between us. God, kid, the four
of us could make a clean job of this thing&mdash;there's
no limit to what we could do!" As he uttered this last,
he grasped me by the arms and shook me.</p>

<p>I knew what he meant&mdash;that with the return of
prosperity, with vast capital ready for investment, with
the control of the packing and food-products transportation
business&mdash;which we packers had been organizing
into a compact machine&mdash;there was no limit to the reach
of our power in this land, in the world. (And I was of
his way of thinking, then, not believing that a power
existed which could check our operations. And I do not
believe it now, I may add; nor do I know a man conversant
with the modern situation of capital who believes
that with our present system of government any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
effective check upon the operations of capital can be
devised.)</p>

<p>"Think it over," Carmichael urged, "and let me know
when I return from Chicago the first of the week. You
don't want to make the mistake of your life by dropping
out just now."</p>

<p>But while he was talking to me, urging on me the
greatness of the future, my thoughts went back to that
letter of Jane Dround's. She had seen swiftly a truth
that was coming to me slowly. There might be twenty,
forty, sixty millions in the packers' deal, but the joy of
the game had gone for me. All of those millions would
not give me the joy I had when I sold that sausage plant
to Strauss! I shook my head.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want it, John. But Strauss's death
makes a big difference. I am willing to offer some kind
of trade with you,&mdash;to let you have my stock on better
terms, if your people will do what I want."</p>

<p>Carmichael waited for my proposal. I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old Parkinson is pretty near his end, I hear. It's
likely there will be a vacant seat in the Senate sometime
soon."</p>

<p>The Irishman's eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Strauss used to keep in touch with Springfield," I
suggested. "He and Vitzer" (who was the great traction
wolf in Chicago) "used to work pretty close together
sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want to go to the Senate, Van?"</p>

<p>Carmichael burst into a laugh that attracted the attention
of the men sitting around us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>"It might work out that way," I admitted.</p>

<p>"And how about that judge business?" he inquired,
still laughing. "The papers would make it some hot
for you."</p>

<p>"No doubt. I don't expect I should be exactly a
popular candidate, John. But I calculate I'd make as
good a Senator as Jim Parkinson, and a deal more useful
one."</p>

<p>Carmichael stopped laughing and began to think, seeing
that there might be a business end to this proposition.
The time was coming when he and his associates would
need the services of an intelligent friend at Washington.
He reckoned up his political hirelings in the state.</p>

<p>"It might be managed," he said after a while, "only
our crowd would want to be sure we could count on you
if we helped put you there. There's a lot of bum, cranky
notions loose in Congress, and it's up to the Senate to
see that the real interests of the country are protected."</p>

<p>"I ought to know by this time what the real interests
are," I assured him, and when he rose to leave for his
train I added pointedly: "In case we make this arrangement
there's more stock than mine which you could count
on for your deal. We'd all stay in with you."</p>

<p>For there was the stock Carboner had locked up in his
safe, and Slocum's, and considerable more that would do
as I said. If Carmichael and young Jenks put through
their merger and swallowed the packing business whole,
I knew that our money would be in good hands.</p>

<p>"Well, when Parkinson gets out we'll see what we can
do," Carmichael concluded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus the deal for Parkinson's seat was made right
there. All that remained was for the old man to have
his second stroke.</p>

<p>"You in the Senate&mdash;that's a good one!" John
chuckled. "I suppose next you will be wanting to be
made Secretary of the Treasury, or President, maybe!"</p>

<p>"I know my limit, John."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;d if I do! The old man would have enjoyed
this. But, Van, take my advice and stay out. There
ain't much in that political business. Stay with us and
make some money. Right now is coming the biggest
time this country has ever seen. And we are the crowd
that's got the combination to the safe. These New York
financiers think they are pretty near the whole thing,
but I reckon we are going to give even them a surprise."</p>

<p>With this final boast, he got into his cab and drove
off.</p>

<p>The day was brilliantly sunny, and the street was
alive with gay people. What the Irishman said was
true&mdash;I felt it in the sunny air: the greatest period of
prosperity this country had ever seen was just starting.
It was the time when two or three good gamblers could
pick up any kind of property, give it a fine name, print
a lot of pretty stock certificates, and sell their gold brick
to the first comer. The people were crazy to spend their
money. It was a great time! Nevertheless, at the bottom
of all this craze was a sure feeling that all was well
with us&mdash;that ours was a mighty people. And that was
about right.</p>

seat in "the millionnaires' club," as the newspapers called
that honorable body, the United States Senate?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Before I left for the West the family sailed for Europe.
Little May and sister Sarah, as we called the girls, had
persuaded their mother to take them over to Paris for a
lark. May, who was thirteen, was running the party.
She was a tall, lively girl, with black hair and eyes, and
was thought to resemble me. The other was quieter in
her ways, more like Sarah. We had lost one little boy
the summer before, which was a great sorrow to us all.
The older boy, who was at school preparing for college,
took after his mother, too. He was a pleasant-mannered
chap, with a liking for good clothes and other playthings.
I did not reckon that he ever would be much of a business
man.</p>

<p>The morning that the steamer sailed Sarah was nervous
over starting, but May settled her in a corner of the
deck and got her a wrap. Then the girls went to say
good-by to some friends.</p>

<p>"Van," Sarah said to me when we were alone. She
hesitated a moment, then went on timidly, "If anything
should happen to us, Van, there's one thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing is going to happen! Not unless you lose
your letter of credit, or the girls run off with you," I
joked.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I want to speak about seriously,
Van. It's May and Will!" She paused timidly.</p>

<p>"Well?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you do something to make them feel differently?"</p>

<p>"I guess not. I've tried my best!"</p>

<p>"I know they are poor, and Will's in bad health, too,&mdash;quite
sick."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw May once before I left. They are in Chicago
again."</p>

<p>After a time I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know I would give half of my money not to
have it so, but it's no use talking. They wouldn't take a
cent from me."</p>

<p>Sarah sighed. "But couldn't you get Will a place
somewhere without his knowing about how it came?"</p>

<p>"I'll try my best," I said sadly.</p>

<p>Then it was time to leave the steamer; the girls came
and kissed me good-by, hanging about my neck and making
me promise to write and to come over for them later.
Sarah raised her veil as I leaned down to kiss her.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Van," she said without much spirit. "Be
careful of yourself and come over if you can get away."</p>

<p>Of late years, especially since the boy's death, Sarah
seemed to have lost her interest in things pretty much.</p>

<p>The trip might do her good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="chap">THE SENATORSHIP</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The people's choice&mdash;What the legislature of a great state represents&mdash;The
Strauss lobby&mdash;Public opinion, pro and con&mdash;An
unflattering description of myself&mdash;Carboner's confidences&mdash;On
the bill-boards&mdash;Popular oratory&mdash;I discover my brother in
strange company&mdash;I do some talking on my own account&mdash;An
organ of kick and criticism&mdash;Turned crank</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Jane Dround was right about old Senator Parkinson.
He came home to die early in the fall, and faded away in
a couple of months afterward. The political pot at the
capital of the state then began to hum in a lively fashion.
It was suspected that the Governor himself wanted to
succeed the late Senator, and there were one or two Congressmen
and a judge whose friends thought they were
of senatorial size. That was the talk on the surface
and in the papers. But the situation was very different
underneath.</p>

<p>The legislature might be said, in a general way, to
represent the people of the state of Illinois, but it represented
also the railroad interests, the traction and gas
interests, and the packers, and when it came to a matter
of importance it pretty generally did what it was
told by its real bosses. This time it was told to put me
in the Senate in place of the late Senator, and it obeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
orders after a time. Carmichael was honest with me,
and stuck to his agreement to use the Strauss lobby in
the legislature in my behalf.</p>

<p>Of course the papers in Chicago howled, all those that
hadn't their mouths stopped with the right cake. The
three largest papers couldn't be reached by our friends
in any way, but their scoring did little harm. They had
up again the story of Judge Garretson and the bonds of
the London and Chicago concern. But the story was getting
a little hazy in men's memories, and that kind of
talk is passed around so often when a man runs for office
in our country that it hasn't much significance. We did
not even think it worth while to answer it. Besides, to
tell the truth, we had nothing much to say. Our policy
was, of necessity, what Slocum sarcastically described as
"dignified silence." When my name began to be heard
at Springfield more and more insistently, the Chicago
<i>Thunderer</i> came out with a terrific roast editorially:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Who is this fellow, E.V. Harrington, who has the
presumption to look lustfully on the chair of our late
honorable Senator? Eighteen years ago Harrington was
driving a delivery wagon for a packing firm, and there
are to-day on the West Side retail marketmen who remember
his calls at their places. We believe that his
first rise in fortune came when, in some tricky way,
he got hold of a broken-down sausage plant, which he
sold later to the redoubtable Strauss. But it was not
until the year '95, when the notorious American Meat
Products Company was launched, that Harrington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
emerged from the obscurity of the Stock Yards. That
corporation, conceived in fraud, promoted by bribery,
was the child of his fertile brain. Not content with this
enterprise, he became involved in railroad promotion in
the Southwest, and he and his man Friday, Slocum, were
celebrated as the most skilful manipulators of legislative
lobbies ever seen in the experienced state of Texas.</p>

<p>"What will Harrington represent in the Senate, assuming
that he will be able to buy his way there? Will he
represent the great state of Illinois,&mdash;the state of Lincoln,
of Douglas, of Oglesby? He will represent the corrupt
Vitzer and the traction interests of Chicago, the infamous
Dosserand and the gas gang&mdash;above all, he will represent
the packers' combine,&mdash;Joe Strauss, Jenks, 'big John'
Carmichael. These citizens, who are secretly preparing to
perpetrate the greatest piece of robbery this country has
ever witnessed, propose to seat Harrington in the United
States Senate as their personal representative. Can the
degradation of that once honorable body be carried to a
greater depth?"</p></blockquote>

<p>It was not a flattering description of myself, but Tom
Stevens, the proprietor of the <i>Thunderer</i>, always hated
Strauss and his crowd, and the papers had to say something.
To offset that dose, the <i>Vermilion County Herald</i>
printed a pleasant eulogy describing me as a type of the
energy and ability of our country,&mdash;"the young man of
farmer stock who had entered the great city without
a dollar and had fought his way up to leadership in the
financial world by his will and genius for commerce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Such practical men, who have had training and experience
in large affairs, are the suitable representatives of a
great commercial people. The nation is to be congratulated
on securing the services of men of Mr. Harrington's
ability, who could with so much more profit to themselves
continue in the career of high finance."</p>

<p>The only trouble with this puff was that it was composed
in the office of my lawyers and paid for at high rates.
But, so far as affecting the result, the <i>Thunderer</i> and the
<i>Vermilion County Herald</i> were about on a par. The
order had gone out from headquarters that I was to be
sent to the Senate to take Parkinson's vacant seat, and,
unless a cyclone swept the country members off their
feet, to the Senate I should go. All that I had to do was
to wait the final roll-call and pay the bills.</p>

<p>My old, tried counsellor, Jaffrey Slocum, was managing
this campaign for me. We could not use him at Springfield,
however; for by this time he was too well known
as one of the shrewdest corporation lawyers in the West.
He represented the United Metals Trust, among other
corporations, and had done some lively lobbying for them
of late. He was a rich man now, and weighed several
stone more than he did when he and I were living at Ma
Pierson's joint. He was married, and had a nice wife,
an ambitious woman, who knew what her husband was
worth. She might push him to New York or Washington
before she was done. Meantime, it was settled that
he should take care of the packers' merger, when that
came off, and that business would mean another fortune
for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, while the election was still pending, I went
over to see Jules Carboner. The old fellow was cheery
as ever, and as pleased to see me as if I had been a good
boy just home from school. We had some of his strong
coffee and talked things over.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, as I was leaving, "let me tell
you now how we happened to get hold of that block of
Products' stock."</p>

<p>And he explained to me the mystery of that stock,
which had saved my life, so to speak, at a critical time.
It seems that about three months before the war scare,
when there were bad rumors about Meat Products all
over the city, Dround had placed his stock in the hands
of a New York firm of bankers. I suppose he was
ashamed to let me know that he was going to break his
last promise to me. For if he didn't tell those bankers
to offer Strauss his stock, he knew that was just what
they would do. So much for the scrupulous Henry I!
The bankers felt around and tried to strike a bargain
with the great packer, and negotiations were under way
for some time about the stock. That gave our enemies
the confidence to sell us short. They thought that, in
case the market went wrong, they could put their hand
on Dround's stock. Just at this point Carboner received
word where the stock was and orders to buy it. He
went to New York the next day and bought it outright,
paying all it was worth, naturally....</p>

<p>I came back from Carboner's place through Newspaper
Row. On the boards in front of the offices one could
read in large red and blue letters:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

HARRINGTON SAID TO BE SLATED FOR THE<br />
SENATE<br />
FINAL BALLOT TO-DAY<br />
</p>

<p>Men passing on their way home from their work
paused to read the bulletin, and I stopped, too. A group
of laboring men were gathered about the door of a building
near by, and from the numbers entering and leaving
the place I judged that some kind of meeting was in
progress within. As I stood there my attention was
caught by a man who went in with several others.
Something about the man's back reminded me of my
brother Will, and I followed into the building and
upstairs to a smoky room, where the men were standing
about in groups, talking together, only now and then
paying any attention to the speaker on the platform.
He was a fat, round little fellow, and he was shouting
himself out of breath:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes! I tell you right here, you and your children are
sold like so many hogs over at the Yards. Don't you
believe it? What do you pay for meat? What do you
pay for every basket of coal you put in your stoves?
The millionnaires there at Washington make the laws of
this free country, and who do they make them for? Don't
you know? Do they make 'em for you, or for Joe
Strauss? They are putting one of their kind in the
Senate from this state right now!"...</p>

<p>So he rambled on, and having sampled his goods,
and not seeing the face I was looking for, I was moving
toward the door, when I was arrested by the voice
of a man who began to speak over in one corner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><i>Men paused to read the bulletin, and I stopped, too.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"That's so.  I know him!" he shouted, and the
attention of the room was his.  The men around him
moved back, and I could see that the speaker was Will.
He was dressed in a long waterproof coat, and his hat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
was tipped back on his head. An untrimmed black
beard covered the lower half of his face. "I can tell
you all about him," he continued in a thin, high voice.
"He's the man who got a
bill through Congress giving
himself and his partners
a slice of land out
of the Indian Territory.
He's the man who kept the
Texas legislature in his
hire the same as a servant."</p>

<p class="caption">"<i>He's the man who sold scraps

</div>

<p>Generally when I hear
this kind of sawing-air I
go about my business. The
discontented always growl
at the other fellow's bone.
Give them a chance at the
meat, and see how many
bites they would make!
It's hopeless to try and
winnow out the truth from
the mass of lies they talk
about the trusts, capital,
the tariff, corruption, and
the rest of it. But it hurt
all the same to have Will
say such things about me....</p>

<p>"He's the man who sold scraps and offal to the Government
for canned beef&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" I spoke out promptly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't I know what I am saying? Didn't I try to
live on the rancid, rotten stuff? My God, I've got some
home now I could show you!"</p>

<p>Will turned to see who had contradicted him, and
recognized me.</p>

<p>"You ought to know better than that," I replied,
directly to him. "Some of it was rotten, but not the
Meat Products' goods. We lost on our contract, too,
what's more."</p>

<p>Will was a little startled, but he steadied himself soon
and said again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the same thing. You were all the same
crowd."</p>

<p>"No; that wasn't so," I remonstrated, "and you
ought to know it."</p>

<p>The men in the room had stopped their talking
and were craning their heads to look at us. Will
and I eyed each other for a time; then I turned to the
crowd and made the first and last real public speech
of my life.</p>

<p>"That's all a d&mdash;&mdash;d lie about the beef <i>we</i> sold the
Government. I know it because I inspected it myself.
And I gave my own money, too, to support men at the
front, and that is more than any of you fellows ever
did. And the rest of the talk these gentlemen have
been giving you is just about as wrong, too. Let me
tell you one thing: if you folks were honest, if you
didn't send rascals to Springfield and to Congress, if you
weren't ready to take a dollar and club a man if he
didn't hand it over, there wouldn't be this bribery busi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>ness.
I know it, because I've got the club over and
over again. And one thing more, it's no more use for you
and I to kick about the men who put their money into
trusts than it would be to try to swallow all the water in
the lake. That's the way business has got to be done
nowadays, and if it weren't done you folks would starve,
and your wives and children would starve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" some began to shout, interrupting
me.</p>

<p>"I am E.V. Harrington!" I called back.</p>

<p>Then they hooted: "Hello, Senator.  Put him out!"</p>

<p>I turned toward Will, and called to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come on! I want to have a word with you, Will."</p>

<p>He followed me downstairs into a saloon. Some of
the loafers who had heard our talk upstairs came in
and crowded up to the bar, and I set up the drinks
all around several times. Will wouldn't take any
whiskey. Then the bartender let us into a little room
at the end of the bar, where we could be by ourselves.</p>

<p>"Will!" I exclaimed, "whatever has happened to
you?"</p>

<p>It wrung my heart to see what a wreck he was.
He had let his beard grow to cover up his wasted face.
His eyes were sunk and bloodshot. The old waterproof
covered a thin flannel coat.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he replied gloomily. "What do you
want of me?"</p>

<p>"I want you to come out and get some dinner with me,
first," I said.</p>

<p>But he shook his head, saying he must go home to May.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>"It ain't no use, Van," he added, in a high, querulous
voice. "We don't belong together. May and I are of
the people&mdash;the people you fatten on."</p>

<p>"Quit that rot! I am one of the people, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're Senator, I expect, by this time," he sneered.
"What did it cost you, Van?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk politics."</p>

<p>"That's all I care to talk. I want to get a chance to
show you fellows up one of these days. I'm considering
a proposition for part control of a paper&mdash;a labor weekly."</p>

<p>So he talked for a while about his scheme of getting
hold of a little three-cent outfit and making it into an
organ of kick and criticism. He had seen life from the
inside during the war, he explained, and he wanted to give
the public the benefit of his experience. He had a snarl
for every conceivable thing that was, and he was eager to
express it. When I showed him that such an attitude
was dead against American feeling, he accused me of trying
to suppress his enterprise because it was aimed at my
friends, "the thieves and robbers." It was hopeless to
argue with him, and the more we talked the worse I felt.
He was just bitter and wild, and he kept saying: "You
taught me what it meant! You showed me what it was
to be rich!" The war had ruined his health and weakened
his mind. The gentle, willing side in him had
turned to fury. He was a plain crank now!</p>

<p>"I'll buy this paper for you&mdash;or I'll start a new one for
you to curse me and my friends with&mdash;if you'll just take
May and the children and go down to my farm in the
country. There are two thousand acres down there, Will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and you can do as you please on the place. When you've
got back your health, then you can start in to baste me
as good as you've a mind to."</p>

<p>But he refused to compromise his "cause." So we
parted at the door of the saloon, he buttoning up his old
raincoat and striding out for the West Side without a
look back to me. And as I hailed a cab to take me to
the club I heard in my ears that charge, "You taught
me what it meant to be rich, Van!" It made me mad,
but it hurt just the same.</p>

<p>Though I knew perfectly well that I was not responsible
for his crankiness, yet I thought that if he could
have kept on at business under me he would have been
all right, earning a good living for his wife and children,
and not taking up with thoughts he hadn't the mind to
think out. For Will was not one to step safely out of the
close ranks of men, but he was always a mighty faithful
worker wherever he was put. And now he was just a
crank&mdash;good for nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE COST</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>A dinner at the Metropolitan Club&mdash;Old friends and enemies&mdash;A
conservative Senator&mdash;Pleasant speeches&mdash;A favor for Henry
I&mdash;I plan a gift for a tried friend&mdash;I find that I have nothing
to give&mdash;Slocum's confession&mdash;Aims in life&mdash;The Supreme
Bench&mdash;What money can't buy&mdash;Slocum pays for both</i></p></blockquote>


<p>A number of men gave me a dinner that evening at the
Metropolitan Club. Steele, Lardner, Morrison (of the New
York and Chicago Railway Company), Joe Strauss, Jenks,
Carmichael, and Bates were there, among others&mdash;all
leaders in the community in various enterprises. Not all
these gentlemen had looked with favor on my political aspirations;
but, when they saw that I could win this trick
as I had others, they sidled up to me. After all, no matter
what they might think of me personally, or of my
methods, they felt that I belonged to their crowd and
would be a safe enough man to have in the Senate.</p>

<p>Just as we sat down, Slocum, who had been called to
the telephone, came up to me, a smile on his wrinkled
face, and said, raising his right hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the legislature at Springfield has elected
Mr. Harrington to fill the unexpired term of the late
Senator Parkinson. Gentlemen, three cheers for Senator
Harrington!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>

<p>As the men raised their champagne glasses to drink to
me, Slocum shook me warmly by the hand, a smile broadening
over his face. Although, as I told them, it had
never been my part to talk, I said a few words, thanking
them for their good-will, and promising them that I
should do my best to serve the interests of the country
we all believed was the greatest nation that had ever
been. My old friend Orlando Bates, the president of
the Tenth National, replied to my talk, expressing the
confidence my associates had in me. In the course
of his graceful speech he said, "Mr. Harrington is so
closely identified with the conservative interests of the
country that we can feel assured he will stand as a bulwark
against the populistic clamor so rife in the nation at
the present time." And young Harvey Sturm, also a bank
president, who followed him with a glowing speech,
made flattering references to the work I had done "in
upbuilding our glorious commonwealth." After deprecating
the growth of socialistic sentiments and condemning
the unrestricted criticism of the press in regard to
capital, he closed with a special tribute: "Such men as
Edward Harrington are the brains and the will of the
nation. On their strong shoulders rests the progress of
America. Were it not for their God-given energy, their
will, their genius for organization, our broad prairies, our
great forests, our vast mines, would cease to give forth
their wealth!"</p>

<p>There was more of the same sort of talk before we broke
up. Afterward, as the theatres and the opera closed,
men dropped in to hear the news, and many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
came up to congratulate me. Among others old Dround
wandered into the club in the course of the evening, and,
some one having told him that I had been elected Senator,
he came up to the corner where I was standing with
a group of men, and hovered around for a time, trying to
get a word with me. After a while I stepped out and
shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear this, Mr. Harrington," he said
slowly, pressing my hand in his trembling fist. "I have
always believed that our best men should take an interest
in the government of their country."</p>

<p>His eyes had a wandering expression, as if he were
trying in vain to remember something out of the past,
and he continued to deliver his little speech, drawing me
to one side out of hearing of the men who were standing
there. "I thought once to enter public life myself," he
said, "but heavy business responsibilities demanded all
my attention. I wonder," he lowered his voice confidentially,
"if you will not find it possible to further the
claims of my old friend Paxton's son. He desires to
secure a diplomatic post. I have urged his merits on
the President, and secured assurance of his good-will;
but nothing has yet been done. I cannot understand
it."</p>

<p>Eri Paxton was a dissipated, no-account sort of fellow,
but I assured Henry I. Dround that I would do my best
for him. That was the least that the past demanded of
me!</p>

<p>So it went on until past midnight, and the club began
to empty, and I was left with a few friends about me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
When they went I took Slocum up to my room for a last
cigar before bed. We had some private matters to settle
in connection with the election.</p>

<p>"You pulled out all right, Van," he said when we were
alone. "But there wasn't much margin."</p>

<p>"I trusted Carmichael&mdash;I knew John wouldn't go
back on me."</p>

<p>We sat and smoked awhile in silence. Now that I had
picked the plum, the feeling came over me that Slocum
ought to have had it. With that idea I burst out at
last:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of one thing all along, Slo&mdash;and
that is: What can I do for you when I am Senator?
Name what you want, man, and if it's in my power to
get it, it shall be yours. Without you I'd never have
been here, and that's sure."</p>

<p>"I never cared much for politics," he replied thoughtfully.
"I guess there isn't anything I want, which is
more than most of your friends can say!"</p>

<p>"Something in the diplomatic service?" I suggested.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>"How about a Federal judgeship&mdash;you can afford to
go out of practice."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can afford to go on the bench!" he replied
dryly. "But it's no use to talk of it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You ought to know, Van, that that is one thing that
can't be bought in this country, not yet. I could no more
get an appointment on the Federal bench than you
could!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean on account of that old story? That's outlawed
years ago!"</p>

<p>"You think so? The public forgets, but lawyers remember,
and so do politicians. The President may make
rotten appointments anywhere else, but if he should
nominate me for the Circuit bench there would be such
a howl go up all over that he would have to withdraw me.
And he knows too much to try any such proposition."</p>

<p>It was no use to argue the question, for the lawyer had
evidently been over the whole matter and knew the facts.</p>

<p>"It isn't that bribery matter, Van, alone; I have been
hand and glove with you fellows too long to be above
suspicion. My record is against me all through. It isn't
worth talking about.... I have had my pay: I am a
rich man, richer than I ever expected to be when I put
foot in Chicago. I have no right to complain."</p>

<p>But I felt that, in spite of all he said, that wasn't
enough&mdash;somehow the money did not make it square for
him. As the night passed, he warmed up more than I
had ever known him to in all the years we had worked
together, and he let me see some way inside him. I remember
he said something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There were three things I promised myself I would
do with my life. That was back in my senior year at
Bowdoin College. I was a poor boy&mdash;had borrowed from
a relative a few hundred dollars to go through college
with, and felt the burden of that debt pretty hard. Well,
of those three purposes, one was for myself. First, I
promised myself I would pay back my uncle's loan. That
was a simple matter of decency. He was not a rich man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and his children felt rather sore at his letting me have
those six hundred dollars to spend on a college education.
I managed to do that out of what I earned as a law clerk
the first years we were together at Ma Pierson's. The
next thing I had promised myself was to buy back our old
brick house in the aristocratic part of Portland&mdash;the
house my father had been obliged to part with after the
panic of '76. I meant to put my mother and sisters in
it. The only sister I have living is there now with her
children. My mother died in her old home, and that
has always been a comfort to me.... You may think
it was my desire to do this that made me stick by you
when we had that difference about the Chicago and London
bonds, but you are mistaken. I went with you, Van,
because I wanted to&mdash;just that. I saw then what it
meant, and I am not kicking now.</p>

<p>"Well, the third aim I set myself when I was speculating,
as college boys do about such things, was the
hardest of all. The others, with reasonable success, I
could hope to accomplish. And I did fulfil them sooner
than I had any reason to hope I should. The third was
a more difficult matter, and that was my ambition to
sit some day on the Supreme Bench. There were two
members of our family who had been distinguished
judges, one of the Supreme Court of Maine, and another
of the Federal Supreme Court, back in the early forties.
I had always heard these two men referred to with the
greatest respect in our family, especially my great-uncle,
Judge Lambert Cushing. Although by the time I came
to college our family had reached a pretty low ebb, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
was natural that I should secretly cherish the ambition
to rise to the high-water mark.</p>

<p>"And," he concluded, "after thirty years of contact
with the world, I haven't seen much that is more worthy
of a man's ambition in our country than a seat on our
Supreme Bench. I have no reason to be ashamed of my
three aims in life. Two of them I made&mdash;the third
I might never have come near to, anyway; but I chucked
away my chance a good many years ago. However, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
have done pretty well by myself as it is. So you see
there is nothing, Van, that you can give me that I should
want to take."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;"><a name="i344" id="i344"></a>
<img src="images/i344.jpg" width="450" height="411" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">"<i>So you see there is nothing, Van, that you can give me that I
should want to take.</i>"</p>
</div>

<p>He reached for another cigar, and stretched his long
legs. It was the first time he had ever spoken to me
from the bottom of his heart, and now that he had revealed
the truth about himself, there was nothing to
be said. He was not just the ordinary corporation
lawyer, who sells his learning and his shrewdness for
a fat fee. I had run up against that kind often enough.
They are an indispensable article to the modern man of
affairs; for the strategy of our warfare is largely directed
by them. But Jaffrey Slocum was much more than such a
trained prostitute: he was a man of learning and a lover
of the law for its own sake. I suspect that if he had
ever sat on the bench he would have been a tough nut
for the corporations....</p>

<p>"There's no better proverb, my friend, than the old
one about the way you make your bed," Slocum summed
up, rising to go. "It don't trouble you, perhaps, because
you are made different. You are made to fit the world as
it is to-day."</p>

<p>With that he bade me good night and went away. I
sat on by myself for some time afterward, thinking, thinking
of it all! Very likely if Slocum could have had his
desire, and gone on the Supreme Bench, he would not
have found it all he had painted it as a boy. But
whether it was foolish or not for him to set such store
by that prize, it was beyond his reach, and the man who
had done most to put him out of the race was I. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
needed him, and I had taken him&mdash;that was all there
was to that. He had sold himself to me, not just for
money, but for friendship and admiration,&mdash;for what
men of his kind sell themselves. For in all the world
there was not enough money to pay him for selling himself&mdash;he
had as much as said so to-night. Now, when
I wanted to give him the gift that he had earned by
years of devotion, there was nothing in my hands that
was worth his taking!</p>

<p>Thinking of this, I forgot for the time being that I
was Senator from the state of Illinois.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>The cab drew up before a one-story frame house that
stood back in the lot, squeezed between two high brick
buildings. This was the number on Ann Street, over
on the West Side, that Will had given me when I had
pressed him for his address. The factories had pretty
well surrounded this section of the city, leaving here and
there some such rickety shanty as this one. There were
several children playing in the strip of front yard, and as
I opened the gate one of them called out, "Hello, Uncle
Van!"</p>

<p>It was Will's second son, little Van. He said his
mother was at home, and, taking my hand, he showed me
around the cottage to the back door. The boy pounded
on the door, and May came to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Van?" she asked, as if she expected
me. "Will said he saw you the other day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not invite me in, but the little boy held open
the door and I walked into the kitchen. The breakfast
things were piled up in the sink, unwashed. A boiler of
clothes was on the fire, and May had her sleeves rolled
up, ready to begin the wash. Her arms were as thin as
pipe-stems, and behind her glasses I saw deep circles of
blue flesh. She had grown older and thinner in the
three years since she and Will left my house for good.</p>

<p>"Will's gone to the city," May remarked.</p>

<p>"He don't look strong, May. It made me feel bad to
see him so&mdash;changed, not a bit like himself."</p>

<p>She seemed to bridle a little at this.</p>

<p>"He hasn't been real well since he had the fever at
Montauk. He was reinfected at the hospital, and nearly
died. When he got out he tried farming down in Texas,
but his strength didn't come back as we expected, and
the climate was too hot for him. So we came North to see
if he could get some easier work."</p>

<p>"How are the children?" I asked, seeing a strange
baby face peep around the corner of the clothes-basket.</p>

<p>"We lost the baby boy while Will was at Montauk.
Another little girl has come since then. We call her
Sarah."</p>

<p>She waited a moment, and then asked hesitatingly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How's your Sarah? She didn't look well when I saw
her last."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;she's been delicate some time&mdash;since our boy
died, last summer. She's gone to Europe with the girls
for a change."</p>

<p>Then we were silent; there was not much more we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
could say without touching the quick. But at last I
burst out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May, why wouldn't you take that money I sent you
while Will was away at the war?"</p>

<p>"We could manage without it. It was kind of you,
though. You have always been kind, Van!"</p>

<p>"You might have known it would make us happy to
have you take it. It was only what I owed to the country,
too, seeing that I was so placed I couldn't go to Cuba.
I wanted then to leave everything and enlist. But it
wouldn't have been fair to others. I sent some men in
my place, though."</p>

<p>Perhaps it sounded a little like apologizing. May
listened with a smile on her lips that heated me.</p>

<p>"You are just like that preacher!" I exclaimed.
"You can see no good in folks unless it's <i>your</i> kind of
good. Don't you believe I have got some real patriotism
in me?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to think of Van Harrington, the new Senator,
as a patriot," she laughed back. "Those men you
sent to the front must have come in handy for the
election!"</p>

<p>I turned red at her little fling about the Senatorship:
my managers <i>had</i> worked that company I equipped for
all it was worth.</p>

<p>"I guess there are a good many worse citizens than I
am. I wanted to fight for those fellows down in Cuba.
And you wouldn't let me do the little I could&mdash;help
Will to take my place."</p>

<p>"After all that happened, Van, we couldn't take it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I suppose you don't want to touch anything
from me now! See here, May, I came over this morning
to do something for you and Will. Did he tell you about
my wanting him to go down to my place in the country
until he got well and strong?"</p>

<p>"He's much interested in this paper, and thinks he
can't get away," she said evasively.</p>

<p>"Darn his paper! You don't believe Will was cut out
to be a thinker? Anyhow, he ought to get his health
back first, and give you an easier time, too."</p>

<p>"I am all right. Will is very much in earnest about
his ideas. You can't get him to think about himself."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind his trying to reform the earth.
If later on he wants a paper to whack the rich with, I'll
buy him one. Come, that's fair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>May laughed at my offer, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"If you folks are so obstinate, if I can't get you to go
down to my place, I'll have to turn it into a school or
something. A fellow I was talking with on the train
the other day gave me an idea of making it into a sort
of reform school for boys. What would you think of
that? Sarah is taken with the idea&mdash;she never liked
the place and won't want to go back, now that the baby
died there."</p>

<p>"That's a good plan&mdash;turning philanthropist, Van?
That's the right way to get popular approval, Senator."</p>

<p>She mocked me, but her laugh rang out good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Popular approval never worried me much. But, May,
I want <i>your</i> good-will, and I mean to get it, too."</p>

<p>For the more obstinate she was, the more she made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
me eager to win my point, to bring her and Will back to
me. She understood this, and a flash of her old will and
malice came into her thin face. She got up to stir the
clothes on the fire, and when the water began to run
over I stripped off my coat and put my hand to the job.
Then I stepped over to the sink.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how I used to wash while you
wiped, when we wanted to get out buggy-riding, May?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you were an awful shiftless worker, Senator,"
May retorted, fetching a dish-towel from the rack and
beginning to wash, while I wiped. "And you had the
same smooth way with you, though in those days you
hadn't ten cents to your name. And now, how much is
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, say a quarter!"</p>

<p>"Then it must have cost you a sight of money to
become Senator."</p>

<p>"It did some, but I kept back a little."</p>

<p>When we had finished the dishes we began on the
clothes. A child's dress caught on the wringer and tore.
It was marked in a fine embroidery with the initials,
J.S. II., for Jaffrey Slocum Harrington&mdash;as we had
thought to call the little chap. May saw me look at the
initials.</p>

<p>"Sarah sent it to me along with a lot of baby things
when my Jack came. Perhaps she might like to have
them back now."</p>

<p>"She and the girls come home next week. Won't you
come and see her? She'd care more for that than for
anything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were always awfully persistent in getting your
own way, Van!"</p>

<p>"But I didn't always get it, I remember."</p>

<p>"It might have been just as well if you hadn't had it
so much of the time since."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are a few other people in the world besides
Van Harrington, and they have their rights, too."</p>

<p>"That's true enough, if they can get 'em."</p>

<p>"Maybe their consciences are a little stronger to hold
them back from getting things. You never held off long
when you wanted a thing, Van. You took the peaches,
you remember?"</p>

<p>Her lips curled in the way that used to set me mad
for her.</p>

<p>"I didn't eat a peach," I protested. "I gave them to
your brothers, and Budd Haines."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>you</i> gave them!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe you think me half as bad as you make
me out!" I said, stopping the wringer and looking into
her eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't know how bad I make you out," she challenged
my look.</p>

<p>It was not hard to see why I had been crazy to marry
her in the old days. There was a fire in her which no
other woman I ever saw possessed. Jane was large-minded,
keen as an eagle, and like steel. But there was
a kind of will in this worn woman, a hanging to herself,
which gave her a character all her own. Nevertheless,
we two couldn't have travelled far hitched together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
She would have tried her best to run me, and life would
have been hell for us both.</p>

<p>"Well," I protested in my own defence, "there's no
man and no woman living has the right to say he's the
worse off on my account. I have treated the world fairly
where it has treated me fairly."</p>

<p>"So that's your boast, Van Harrington! It's pretty
hard when a man has to say a thing like that to defend
his life. You don't know how many men you have
ruined like that poor Hostetter. But that isn't the
worst. The very sight of men like you is the worst evil
in our country. You are successful, prosperous, and you
have ridden over the laws that hindered you. You
have hired your lawyers to find a way for you to do what
you please. You think you are above the law&mdash;just
the common laws for ordinary folks! You buy men as
you buy wheat. And because you don't happen to have
robbed your next-door neighbor or ruined his daughter,
you make a boast of it to me. It's pretty mean, Van,
don't you think so?"</p>

<p>We had sat down facing each other across the tub of
clothes. As she spoke her hot words, I thought of others
who had accused me in one way or another,&mdash;Parson,
Will, Slocum,&mdash;most of all, Slocum. But I dismissed
this sentimental reflection.</p>

<p>"Those are pretty serious charges you are making,
May," I replied after a time. "And what do you know?
What the newspapers say. There are thousands of
newspaper men all over this country who get a dollar or
two a column for that sort of mud. Then these same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
fellows come around to us and hold out their hands for
tips or bribes. You take their lies for proved facts. I
have never taken the trouble to answer their charges, and
never shall. I will answer for what I have done."</p>

<p>"To whom?" May asked ironically. "To God? I
should like to see Van Harrington's God! He must be
different from the One I have prayed to all these years."</p>

<p>"Maybe he has more charity, May!"</p>

<p>"Are you asking for charity&mdash;my charity as well as
God's?" she blazed.</p>

<p>"Well, let that go! I shall answer to the people
now."</p>

<p>"Yes! And God help this country, now that men like
you have taken to buying seats there at Washington!"</p>

<p>We said nothing for a while after this, and then I rose
to go.</p>

<p>"We don't get anywhere this way, May. I came here
wanting to be friends with you and Will&mdash;wanting to
help my brother. You needn't take my money if you
think it's tainted. But can't you feel friendly? You
are throwing me off a second time when I come to you
asking for your love."</p>

<p>She flushed at the meaning under my words, and replied
in a lower voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would do no good, Van. You are feeling humble
just now, and remorseful, and full of old memories. But
you don't want my love now, in real truth, more than you
did before." Her face crimsoned slowly. "If you had
wanted it then, you would have stayed and earned it."</p>

<p>"And I could have had it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of answering she came up to me and took my
arms in her two hands and pulled my head to her.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Van!" she said, kissing me.</p>

<p>As I stepped out of the door I turned for the last time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can't you let me do something for my brother, who is
a sick man?"</p>

<p>Tears came to her eyes, but she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I know he's sick, and likely to fail in what he's
doing. But it can't be helped!"</p>

<p>Outside little Van was sitting on the ground playing
with a broken toy engine. I put my hand on his little
tumbled head, and turned to his mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't let him touch my money,
either?"</p>

<p>She smiled back her defiance through her tears.</p>

<p>"You had rather he'd grow up in the alley here than
let me give him an education and start him in life!"</p>

<p>I waited several moments for her answer.</p>

<p>"Yes!" she murmured at last, very faintly.</p>

<p>The little fellow looked from his mother to me curiously,
trying to make out what we were saying.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So I went back to the city, having failed in my purpose.
I couldn't get that woman to yield an inch. She
had weighed me in her scales and found me badly wanting.
I was Senator of these United States, from the
great state of Illinois; but there was Hostetter, and the
old banker Farson, and my best friend Slocum, and my
brother Will, and May, and their little children, who
stood to one side and turned away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>The smoke of the city I had known for so long drifted
westward above my head. The tall chimneys of the
factories in this district poured forth their stream to
swell the canopy that covered the heavens. The whir of
machinery from the doors and windows of the grimy
buildings filled the air with a busy hum; the trucks
ground along in the car tracks. Traffic, business, industry,&mdash;the
work of the world was going forward. A huge
lumber boat blocked the river at the bridge, and while
the tugs pushed it slowly through the draw, I stood and
gazed at the busy tracks in the railroad yards below me,
at the line of high warehouses along the river. I, too,
was a part of this. The thought of my brain, the labor
of my body, the will within me, had gone to the making
of this world. There were my plants, my car line, my
railroads, my elevators, my lands&mdash;all good tools in the
infinite work of the world. Conceived for good or for
ill, brought into being by fraud or daring&mdash;what man
could judge <i>their</i> worth? There they were, a part of
God's great world. They were done; and mine was the
hand. Let another, more perfect, turn them to a larger
use; nevertheless, on my labor, on me, he must build.</p>

<p>Involuntarily my eyes rose from the ground and looked
straight before me, to the vista of time. Surely there
was another scale, a grander one, and by this I should
not be found wholly wanting!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="chap">THE END</p>

<blockquote><p class="small hang2"><i>The senatorial party&mdash;Mrs. Jenks's pearls&mdash;Gossip&mdash;One good
deed&mdash;The Duchess brand&mdash;I take my seat in the Senate&mdash;Red
roses</i></p></blockquote>


<p>When it came time to go to Washington to take my
seat, my friend Major Frederickson, of the Atlantic and
Great Western road, placed his private car at my disposal
and made up a special train for my party. Sarah and the
girls had come back from Paris in time to accompany me
to Washington. The girls were crazy over going; they
saw ahead a lot of parties and sights, and I suppose had
their ideas about making foreign matches some day. The
boy was to meet us there, and he was rather pleased, too,
to be the son of a Senator.</p>

<p>Among those who made the trip with us there were
Slocum and his wife, of course, John Carmichael, young
Jenks and his pretty little wife, and a dozen or more
other friends. We had a very pleasant and successful
journey. A good deal of merriment was occasioned by
a string of pearls that young Mrs. Jenks wore, which had
lately been the talk of the city. The stones were of
unusual size and quality, and had been purchased through
a London dealer from some titled person. Jenks had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
given them as a present to his wife because of the success
of the beef merger, which had more than doubled the fortune
old Randolph Jenks left him when he died. The
pearls, being so perfect and well known in London, caused
a lot of newspaper talk. They were said to be the finest
string in the United States; there were articles even in
the magazines about Mrs. Jenks and her string of pearls.
Finally, some reporter started the story that there was a
stone for every million dollars Jenks had "screwed out
of the public by the merger"&mdash;twenty-seven in all. (For
these days there was beginning to be heard all over the
clamor about the price of food, and how the new combination
of packers was forcing up prices&mdash;mere guesswork
on the part of cheap socialistic agitators that was
being taken seriously by people who ought to know
better.) One paper even had it that pretty little Mrs.
Jenks "flaunted around her neck the blood-bought price
of a million lives!"</p>

<p>So it had come to be a sort of joke among us, that
string of pearls. Whenever I saw it, I would pretend
to count the stones and ask Mrs. Jenks how many
more million lives she was wearing around her neck
to-night. She would laugh back in her pretty little
Southern drawl:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The papers do say such dreadful things! Pretty
soon I shan't dare to wear a single jewel in public.
Ralph says it's dangerous to do it now, there are so
many cranks around. Don't you think it's horrid of
them to talk so?"</p>

<p>Sarah had her string of pearls, too, but it was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
smaller than the famous one of Mrs. Jenks. Sarah
didn't altogether like Mrs. Jenks, and used to say that
she plastered herself with jewels to show who she was.</p>

<p>Well, the pearls went to Washington with us on this
trip, and made quite a splendid show, though we used
to joke Ralph Jenks about sitting up nights to watch his
wife's necklace. The fame of the pearls had got to
Washington ahead of us, and the Washington <i>Eagle</i>
had a piece in about the arrival at the Arlington of
the new Senator from Illinois and the "packers' contingent"
with their pearls! People used to turn around
in the corridors and stare at us&mdash;not so much at the
new Senator as at Mrs. Jenks's pearls!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I had already taken a house in Washington for the
winter, and Sarah soon was busy in having it done over
for us. We had shut up the Chicago house, and after
discussing the matter with Sarah I concluded to turn
over the Vermilion County property to a society, to be
used for a reform school. Sarah talked it over with
the young fellow I met on the train, who first put the
idea into my head, and she seemed to take great pleasure
in the plan, wanting me to give an endowment for the
institution, which I promised as soon as my packing-company
stock was straightened out. Now that I had
failed to put Will and his family down there, as I had
set my heart on doing, I had no more wish to go back to
the place than Sarah had. And as a home to take boys
to who hadn't a fair chance in life, it might do some good
in the world.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a pleasant, warm day when my colleague, Senator
Drummond, came to escort me to the Senate. My
secretary and Slocum accompanied us up the broad steps
toward the Senate chamber. As we turned in from the
street with the Capitol rising before us, my eye fell upon
a broad advertising board beside the walk, on a vacant
piece of property. One of the conspicuous advertisements
caught my attention:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cen ps">
THE DUCHESS BRAND<br />
STRICTLY FARM-MADE SAUSAGE<br />
BEST IN THE WORLD<br />
</p>

<p>It was one of Strauss's "ads." Slocum pointed to it
with a wave of his hand and glanced at me; and I
thought I caught a smile on the lips of my colleague,
which might have been scornful. So I paused before we
passed beyond sight of the sign of the Duchess brand.</p>

<p>"It was good sausage, Slo! At least it was when we
made it."</p>

<p>"And it did pretty well by you!" he laughed.</p>

<p>Senator Drummond had moved forward with my secretary.
"Yes! The Duchess was all right." Then we
followed the others slowly up the great steps....</p>

<p>In the Senate chamber, in one of the galleries, a group
of women were sitting about Sarah, waiting to see me
take the oath. One of them waved a handkerchief at
me, and as I looked up I caught sight of Mrs. Jenks's
pearls when she leaned forward over the rail.</p>

<p class="pb">On my desk there was a bunch of American Beauty
roses: I did not have to look for the card to know that
they had come from Jane.</p>
